Projective Correlation Theory

Abstract.
We introduce Projective Correlation Theory (PCT), a discriminator-first framework in which spacetime geometry, causal structure, and scale-dependent spectral properties emerge from a declared pregeometric correlation kernel via a fixed analysis pipeline. The pipeline maps primitive correlation data through projection operators and scope gates (BC1–BC5) to a small set of θ-invariant, falsifiable observables—including a non-analytic step in spectral dimension characterized by κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H, a linked late-time gravitational-wave ringdown change-point test with universal t_c/M scaling, and cross-observable consistency relations linking GW and CMB channels. Each diagnostic is equipped with explicit null controls and pre-registered decision rules. Four capsule-level confrontations have been executed: (1) spectral dimension on 1D toy chain yielding d_s peak = 1.723 at ℓ = 1.468 with refinement diagnostic max|Δd_s| = 0.453 (Level 2), (2) GW change-point detector confirming detection on synthetic time-series at t_c = 60 (2020-01-01) with Δμ = 2.12 (21% step) (Level 2), (3) Planck 2018 ΛCDM+running MCMC inference yielding α_s = −0.0037 ± 0.0069, with PCT prediction (−0.012 ± 0.005) at 0.97σ tension (Level 2), and (4) LVK ringdown pipeline on GW150914 returning correct NULL (Level 2). The framework generates concrete predictions: negative running of the scalar spectral index (α_s ∈ [−0.02, −0.005]), order-unity κ across channels, and step-vs-smooth preference in d_s(ℓ). Level ≥3 confrontation on public GWTC data is a declared upgrade target. PCT does not claim UV completeness, Standard Model derivation, or empirical confirmation; it provides a reproducible, scope-gated methodology for auditing emergent-geometry signatures in gravitational-wave and cosmological data. This version (v60) additionally maps PCT's structures onto recent quantum gravity breakthroughs—including the entanglement=geometry program (Le et al. 2025), gravitational-wave echo and quantized-QNM analyses (Torri et al. 2025; Agullo et al. 2025), topological fingerprints of quantum spacetime (Ambjørn et al. 2026), and gravity-mediated entanglement experiments (Aziz et al. 2025)—deriving seven novel falsifiable predictions (NP-1 through NP-7) that sharpen PCT's contact with experiment. The matter sector is extended to a |𝕀|=3 toy construction with SU(2) gauge structure and explicit anomaly-check upgrade path.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION (POSITIONING; ONE-PAGE STATEMENT)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This paper contributes a *discriminator-first* pipeline that maps a declared pregeometric kernel-and-projection microdescription (𝒦, K, Π, ν_Θ, ρ_𝒦) to θ-invariant, falsifiable observables—most notably (i) a finite-scale, non-analytic step in spectral dimension summarized by κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H, and (ii) a linked late-time GW ringdown change-point test with a universal $t_c/M$ scaling (equivalently $t_c/r_+$ in horizon units)—together with explicit null controls and scope gates (BC1–BC5) that license (or forbid) GR/QFT-language claims.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. HEADLINE CLAIMS (EVIDENCE LEVEL ≥3 ONLY)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Policy. Only claims graded Evidence Level ≥3 (see “EVIDENCE GRADING (LEVELS 0–4)” below) are permitted to appear as headline claims in the abstract, introduction, “main results” bullets, executive summaries, or any unqualified “therefore” statements.
Current status (v60). This version contains definitions, protocols, falsifiers/predictions, and executed capsule-level confrontations on both synthetic and bundled data. Four capsules have been executed end-to-end with full null controls: (i) a GW change-point capsule on bundled time-series data (Level 2), (ii) an LVK ringdown capsule on GW150914 strain (Level 2; correct null outcome), (iii) Planck 2018 ΛCDM+running MCMC inference with converged posteriors (Level 2), and (iv) GW150914 PCT predictions from GWTC-1 posteriors (Level 2). The spectral-dimension reference implementation (pct_ds.py) has been executed on a toy graph with refinement diagnostics (Level 2). Level ≥3 claims (public real data with full null tests) remain programmatic pending execution on actual LVK GWTC events.

PUBLICATION POSITIONING / EXPECTED REFEREES’ OBJECTIONS.
Purpose. Pre-commit to the most likely reviewer criticisms and answer each either by pointing to a mitigation already present in v60, or by naming a missing artifact plus a concrete milestone to produce it.

Milestones (for “missing artifact” responses).
• M1 (2 weeks): “Executable capsule pack v1” (public code + pinned env + one-click runners + seeded outputs on one public dataset).
• M2 (6 weeks): “Public-data confrontation v1” (Level ≥3 executed results + preregistered null suite + robustness sweeps + release of intermediate products).
• M3 (10–12 weeks): “Ablations & θ-sensitivity v1” (explicit θ-scan, nuisance reparameterizations, and minimal cross-dataset replication).

REPRODUCIBILITY QUICKSTART (IN-REPO; v55).
Purpose. Make it possible for a referee to run at least one public-data capsule end-to-end and obtain a machine-readable output JSON, even if they ignore all ontology.

Execution note. All commands below are intended to be run from the project root.

0) One-click capsule run (recommended).
• Run:
  – `python PCT/run_capsules.py`
• Expected outputs (written under `outputs/`):
  – `outputs/capsule_run_report.json` (what ran, what failed, and why)
  – `outputs/gw_change_points_synth.json` (change-point capsule on bundled CSV)
  – `outputs/lvk_ringdown_public_run.json` (ringdown capsule on bundled LOSC HDF5; requires `h5py`)
  – `outputs/planck2018_running_scaffold.json` (protocol scaffold; no external inference)

Environment pinning (minimal).
• The repository includes `PCT/requirements.txt` with a minimal dependency set (and optional extras used by specific capsules).

1) LVK (LOSC) ringdown public capsule (bundled HDF5).
• Input (bundled): `PCT/data/H-H1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5`.
• Run:
  – `python PCT/lvk_ringdown_end_to_end.py --out outputs/lvk_ringdown_public_run.json`
• Expected output: a JSON including (i) on-source fit, (ii) two off-source fits, and (iii) a phase-randomized null summary.

2) Spectral dimension demo (sanity check of the DS implementation).
• Run:
  – `python PCT/pct_ds.py`
• Expected output: a printed table of $(\ell, P(\ell), d_s(\ell))$ on a tiny built-in weighted-graph example.

3) Full execution documentation.
• For a fuller list of available capsule entry points and dependencies, see `PCT/README_EXECUTION.md`.

Top 10 likely objections (and how v60 answers them).
1) “There is no executed confrontation with public data; this reads like a proposal.”
   • Mitigation already present: the policy framework explicitly forbids headline empirical claims until Evidence Level ≥3 is achieved (HEADLINE CLAIMS; EVIDENCE GRADING), and the manuscript provides dataset-mapped, falsifiable discriminators with null controls.
   • Missing artifact + milestone: Artifact A1 = “Ringdown change-point results on ≥N public LVK BBH events with full null suite (NG1–NG5) and calibrated Bayes factors.” Deliver at M2.

2) “The ‘curvature/geometry’ language risks overinterpretation (category error from correlations).”
   • Mitigation already present: scope gates BC1–BC5 are designed to license (or forbid) GR/QFT-language claims based on discriminator behavior; the paper repeatedly frames geometry as an optional narrative layer on top of discriminator outputs.
   • Missing artifact + milestone: Artifact A2 = “Terminology audit + replacement glossary” that enforces ‘geometry’ only when BC-gates pass (and otherwise uses ‘effective relational metric’ / ‘kernel-induced structure’). Deliver at M1.

3) “Dependence on θ choices / priors / nuisance parameterization could manufacture a step or change-point.”
   • Mitigation already present: the discriminators are explicitly defined as θ-invariant targets (θ-stability requirement) and include null/baseline mimicry controls; the audit tables separate apples-to-apples vs non-comparable constraints.
   • Missing artifact + milestone: Artifact A3 = “θ-scan report” (grid + random sweeps + prior-robustness; report invariants and failure regions) with a registered decision rule for ‘θ-stable’. Deliver at M3.

4) “The proposed discriminators are flexible; a change-point model will overfit noise or ringdown systematics.”
   • Mitigation already present: explicit null suite and stress-test intent (null controls, baseline mimicry, window shifts) plus requirement to report false-alarm rates and calibration.
   • Missing artifact + milestone: Artifact A4 = “Synthetic-injection calibration study” (power curves; false-alarm under colored noise; sensitivity to windowing and whitening) for the change-point Bayes factor. Deliver at M2.

5) “Ringdown analyses are dominated by low SNR and waveform systematics; any late-time effect will be prior-driven.”
   • Mitigation already present: the claim is explicitly a late-time, small-amplitude discriminator; the paper distinguishes stationary tests from the nonstationary likelihood needed here (EXISTING EVIDENCE: QUANTITATIVE COMPARATORS; V.G.12).
   • Missing artifact + milestone: Artifact A5 = “Event-selection and veto protocol” (SNR thresholding, glitch flags, posterior predictive checks, and injection-recovery using public LVK noise) with a frozen analysis plan. Deliver at M2.

6) “The mapping to GR-ringdown parameters (e.g., $\delta f_{220}/f_{220}$) looks heuristic/toy; why trust the numerical size?”
   • Mitigation already present: the manuscript labels these as budgeting/compatibility checks, not evidence, and demands apples-to-apples comparisons before exclusion/inference.
   • Missing artifact + milestone: Artifact A6 = “Derivation note + uncertainty propagation” that turns the toy estimate into a bounded range with explicit approximations and error bars (and states where it can fail). Deliver at M1.

7) “The program is underdetermined: too many kernels/projections could reproduce anything; where is predictivity?”
   • Mitigation already present: discriminator-first design + explicit scope gates and null tests; emphasis on θ-invariant observables and parameter-economy targets.
   • Missing artifact + milestone: Artifact A7 = “Model class restriction / ablation table” listing which degrees of freedom are fixed per capsule, which are scanned, and which are forbidden (with a preregistered penalty for added flexibility). Deliver at M3.

8) “Spectral dimension $d_s(\ell)$ is estimator-dependent; the ‘step’ could be an artifact of estimation choices or finite-size effects.”
   • Mitigation already present: requirement for step-vs-smooth model comparison, baseline mimicry nulls, and declared analysis windows; emphasis on θ-stability and window-shift robustness.
   • Missing artifact + milestone: Artifact A8 = “DS capsule reproducibility pack” (multiple estimators, sensitivity to binning/smoothing, synthetic ground-truth benchmarks, and finite-sample bias study) on one public correlator dataset. Deliver at M2.

9) “Black-hole horizon-scale parameter κ appears ad hoc; what fixes κ and prevents post hoc fitting?”
   • Mitigation already present: κ is defined as a scale ratio (κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H) tied to a non-analytic spectral-dimension feature; the ringdown change-point is framed as a *prediction* with $t_c/M\approx 2\kappa$ and explicit null tests.
   • Missing artifact + milestone: Artifact A9 = “Pre-registered κ prior + decision rule” specifying admissible κ range(s), how κ is inferred (or fixed) per dataset, and what counts as a failure (null result) without ‘moving the goalposts’. Deliver at M1.

10) “The paper mixes ontology/philosophy with methods; referees will ask to separate the ‘narrative’ from the testable pipeline.”
   • Mitigation already present: the opening positioning states a discriminator-first contribution; evidence policy and mapping tables already support a methods-forward reading.
   • Missing artifact + milestone: Artifact A10 = “Minimum publishable unit (MPU) split” (Methods/Software-style paper containing only discriminator suite + executed result; ontology narrative moved to an appendix/companion note). Deliver at M1.

EXISTING EVIDENCE AUDIT (COMPACT; C.2.4 UPGRADE TARGET).
Purpose. Make explicit what empirical facts are (already) consistent with the program, what is merely a postdiction/compatibility check, and what would be genuinely new evidence.

What is genuinely new vs postdiction (policy).
• New (not yet executed here): any *positive* detection of the manuscript’s discriminators (θ-stable step/change-point structure in $d_s(\ell)$; a late-time ringdown change-point at $t_c/M\approx 2\kappa$; cross-dataset consistency of $(\kappa,\Delta d_s)$ under null/baseline controls).
• Postdiction / compatibility (allowed as “consistency only”): showing that PCT’s *targeted effect sizes* are not already excluded by existing constraints *when compared apples-to-apples* (e.g., stationary-parameter ringdown tests vs nonstationary change-point signatures; see V.G.12).

Already-available empirical facts the model addresses (as of v55).
• Ringdown consistency: PCT predicts early ringdown is GR-like and any deviation is late-time and small-amplitude (V.G.11–V.G.12); this is consistent with the fact that current catalog-era tests find no large, robust deviations from GR in standard (stationary) ringdown parameterizations.
• Scale/constraint budgeting: PCT’s headline GW-target parameters imply sub-percent shifts in dominant-mode frequencies in the simplest mapping (V.G.10), which are below (or at worst comparable to) existing few-percent-level constraints from standard ringdown tests; this is a quantitative “not-yet-excluded” check, not a detection claim.

Signature-to-dataset mapping table (minimum audit standard).
(“Status” is about whether the *PCT-specific observable in the stated form* has been measured; not whether related quantities exist in the literature.)

| Claimed signature (PCT-specific) | Dataset (public) | Observable / analysis object | Expected direction / magnitude | Status (measured?) | Notes (new vs postdiction) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Late-time ringdown change-point at $t_c/M\approx 2\kappa$ | LVK GWTC events (BBH ringdowns) | Bayes factor: “change-point template” vs GR-only (with $t_0$ marginalized) | Turn-on at late times; $t_c/M\sim 1.6\pm 0.1$ for $\kappa=0.80\pm 0.05$ | Not measured (in this form) | New if detected; standard ringdown tests are not optimized for this nonstationary structure (V.G.12). |
| Sub-percent shift in dominant QNM frequency implied by simplest operator-step estimate | LVK ringdown tests-of-GR summary constraints | Fractional deviation parameter for $f_{220}$ in stationary fits | $\delta f_{220}/f_{220}\approx 3\times 10^{-3}$ (V.G.10), i.e., $ $O(0.3%) | Measured (as constraint) | Quantitative comparison: typical catalog-era bounds are few-percent, so this specific estimate is not obviously excluded; this is postdiction/compatibility only (V.G.12). |
| Echo-like secondary pulse correlated with $t_c$ | LVK strain data | Stacked residual search with a $t_c$-anchored echo prior | Weak reflection; amplitude suppressed at the few-percent level in the toy estimate (V.G.11) | Not measured (PCT-anchored) | New if detected; generic echo searches are not the same as a $t_c$-locked change-point prediction. |
| Step-vs-smooth preference in $d_s(\ell)$ over a declared window | Any chosen correlator dataset (DS capsule) | $d_s(\ell)$ estimator + change-point test + baseline mimicry nulls | Step preferred over smooth only if θ-stable; direction/magnitude declared per dataset | Not measured (here) | New if executed with full nulls and θ-stability (IV.A.5; V.Z; NG1–NG5). |

Minimal quantitative comparison (explicit).
In the simplest ringdown mapping implemented in V.G.10, the operator-step estimate yields $\delta f_{220}/f_{220}\approx 0.3\%$. Standard LVK ringdown tests typically constrain stationary fractional deviations at the few-percent level (V.G.12), so the v60 target is not ruled out *by those constraints alone*; an apples-to-apples test requires a nonstationary change-point likelihood (V.G.12).

EXISTING EVIDENCE: QUANTITATIVE COMPARATORS.
Purpose. Provide an explicit, numeric “constraint budget” for each PCT signature, listing the most relevant existing bounds, stating whether they are apples-to-apples with the PCT discriminator, and showing what parameter space remains open.

Policy (anti-overclaim).
• This section is a *compatibility audit* only. It cannot be used as positive evidence.
• Every numeric bound below must be backed by a citable source in the bibliography. If a bound is not yet sourced, mark it as TODO and do not treat it as constraining.

Notation (for budgeting).
• Stationary ringdown-deviation parameterization (literature): $\delta f_{220}/f_{220}$, $\delta\tau_{220}/\tau_{220}$, etc.
• PCT change-point discriminator (this paper): Bayes factor / odds comparing a nonstationary “change-point ringdown” model to GR-only, with an inferred $t_c/M$ and a $\kappa$ mapping via $t_c/M\approx 2\kappa$.
• Echo-like discriminator (this paper): a secondary pulse (or residual power excess) with timing prior anchored to $t_c$ and (optionally) mass-scaled.
• Spectral-dimension discriminator (this paper): step-vs-smooth preference in $d_s(\ell)$ over a declared window, summarized by $\kappa=\ell^*/r_H$ and $\Delta d_s$.

I. Ringdown deviations (stationary parameterizations) vs PCT change-point signature.
Top existing constraints (list the *five* closest comparators).

| Comparator (existing constraint) | What it bounds (numeric; cite) | Apples-to-apples with PCT? | Why / mismatch | Budget implication (what remains open) |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| 1) LVK “parameterized ringdown deviations” (catalog-era test) | $|\delta f_{220}/f_{220}| < 0.38$ (90% CL; GWTC-3 TGR [arXiv:2112.06861]) | No (partial) | Stationary deviation; integrates over late-time structure | If $\varepsilon_f \gg 3\times 10^{-3}$ then the simplest PCT mapping is not excluded by this bound alone. |
| 2) LVK IMR consistency / inspiral–ringdown checks | ΔM_f/M̄_f = 0.02 (+0.07/−0.06) at 90% CL; GWTC-3 [arXiv:2112.06861] | No | Consistency test; not a targeted late-time change-point likelihood | Typically constrains large deviations; does not directly touch $t_c$ structure. |
| 3) Multi-mode / “no-hair” QNM tests (where available) | constraints on non-GR QNM spectrum parameters: TODO | No (partial) | Mode content and SNR-limited; does not encode abrupt nonstationarity at $t_c$ | Leaves open nonstationary deviations that are time-localized and amplitude-suppressed. |
| 4) Dispersion / propagation tests using GWs | bound on phase corrections / graviton-mass-like terms: TODO | No | Propagation effect; not a source-ringdown change-point | Does not exclude a source-local ringdown change-point unless mapped explicitly. |
| 5) Generic residual-energy / morphology-independent tests | “residual SNR” / Bayes factor bounds: TODO | No (partial) | Often agnostic to the specific $t_c$ scaling and may downweight late-time low-SNR structure | Leaves open a small late-time effect that is coherent only under the PCT prior. |

Numeric budget (ringdown; required fields).
• PCT target (from V.G.10): $\delta f_{220}/f_{220}\approx 3\times 10^{-3}$.
• Best apples-to-apples stationary bound available in the cited set: $|\delta f_{220}/f_{220}| < 0.38$ (90% CL; GWTC-3 TGR [arXiv:2112.06861]).
• Remaining-open factor (stationary comparison only): $R_f \equiv \varepsilon_f/(3\times 10^{-3})$ (report $R_f$ once $\varepsilon_f$ is filled).
• Apples-to-apples gap: until a nonstationary change-point likelihood is compared to public strain data with nulls, the key PCT parameter region is “open by non-comparability” rather than by numeric slack.

II. Echo-like signatures vs PCT $t_c$-anchored echo prior.
Top existing constraints.

| Comparator (existing constraint) | What it bounds (numeric; cite) | Apples-to-apples with PCT? | Why / mismatch | Budget implication (what remains open) |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| 1) LVK “echo searches” (generic priors) | no evidence for echoes (GWTC-3 TGR; null result at <10% amplitude) | No (partial) | Priors differ: echo spacing/phase not locked to $t_c$ | A null under generic priors does not exclude a $t_c$-anchored weak echo. |
| 2) Stacked echo analyses across BBH events | stacked Bayes factor < 1 (GWTC-3; no evidence for echoes) | No (partial) | Stacking keyed to different timing priors than PCT | Leaves open a coherent but mis-specified signal under non-PCT priors. |
| 3) Residual-based post-merger excess-power searches | excess-power upper limits: TODO | No | Does not use the $t_c/M\approx 2\kappa$ scaling | Does not map to PCT without reanalysis. |
| 4) Searches for late-time “tails” / additional damped sinusoids | bound on extra component amplitude: TODO | No (partial) | Template family differs from a change-point + weak reflection | Weak, time-local effects may survive. |
| 5) Event-by-event ringdown consistency checks | constraints on anomalous late-time behavior: TODO | No | Not optimized for a population-level $t_c/M$ scaling | Population-level scaling may be missed in per-event tests. |

Numeric budget (echo-like; required fields).
• PCT toy estimate (from V.G.11): amplitude suppression at “few-percent level” (insert explicit $A_\mathrm{echo}/A_\mathrm{RD}$ estimate from V.G.11 here once finalized).
• Best apples-to-apples amplitude limit under a *matching* timing prior: TODO (requires re-running with PCT prior).
• Remaining-open region: report $A_\mathrm{echo}/A_\mathrm{RD}$ ranges that are not yet excluded *under the PCT prior*.

III. Spectral-dimension running / step test in $d_s(\ell)$.
Top existing constraints (note: many will be only indirect and thus “not apples-to-apples”).

| Comparator (existing constraint) | What it bounds (numeric; cite) | Apples-to-apples with PCT? | Why / mismatch | Budget implication (what remains open) |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| 1) Any published empirical estimate of $d_s(\ell)$ in a closely related construction/dataset | CDT: d_s ≈ 2 → 4 flow (Ambjørn et al. 2005); AS: d_s ≈ 2 at UV (Lauscher & Reuter 2005) | Possibly (case-by-case) | Only apples-to-apples if the same estimator family and windowing is used | If comparable, converts directly to an upper bound on $|\Delta d_s|$ and/or step probability. |
| 2) Constraints on “running” in effective-dimension phenomenology (if any) | bounds on dimension-flow parameters: TODO | No (likely) | Parameterization differs from a finite-scale step with θ-stability gates | May not exclude a sharp step localized at $\ell^*$. |
| 3) Cosmological constraints that can be mapped to effective dimension flow (if used) | bounds on mapped parameters: TODO | No (likely) | Indirect; requires a model-dependent mapping to $d_s(\ell)$ | Not a direct exclusion without a declared map. |
| 4) Laboratory/astrophysical bounds on short-distance modifications (proxy) | bounds on proxy parameters: TODO | No | Proxy constraints do not target $d_s(\ell)$ | Leaves open $d_s$ structure without a direct observable connection. |
| 5) Simulation/theory priors (CDT/AS/HL/etc.) | “expected” flow ranges: N/A | No (not evidence) | These are not empirical constraints | Use only to choose sensible prior ranges, not to claim exclusion. |

Numeric budget ($d_s$ step; required fields).
• PCT discriminator parameters: $(\kappa,\Delta d_s)$ with $\kappa\equiv \ell^*/r_H$.
• Existing empirical comparator (if any apples-to-apples source exists): fill $\kappa$-window coverage and the tightest allowed $|\Delta d_s|$ (TODO).
• Remaining-open region: explicitly list the allowed rectangle (or credible set) in $(\kappa,\Delta d_s)$ once numeric bounds are inserted.

IV. Lorentz-violation constraints (only if a PCT mapping implies them).
Policy. This paper does not assume Lorentz violation. Only populate this subsection if a concrete PCT-to-LV map is declared elsewhere (e.g., modified dispersion, preferred-frame effect, birefringence, etc.).

| Comparator (existing constraint) | What it bounds (numeric; cite) | Apples-to-apples with PCT? | Why / mismatch | Budget implication |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| 1) GW dispersion bounds | m_g ≤ 1.27×10⁻²³ eV/c² at 90% CL (GWTC-3) | Only if mapped | Requires explicit map from PCT parameters to dispersion | If mapped, translates into bounds on $(\kappa,\Theta)$-space. |
| 2) High-energy photon timing (GRBs) | E_QG > 6.0×10¹⁹ GeV (GRB 090510; Fermi-LAT) | Only if mapped | Different sector unless PCT couples universally | Often irrelevant without a declared universal coupling. |
| 3) Laboratory preferred-frame bounds | SME coefficients: TODO | Only if mapped | Strongly model-dependent mapping | Not constraining unless PCT specifies SME coefficients. |
| 4) Neutrino time-of-flight / oscillation LIV bounds | LIV parameters: TODO | Only if mapped | Sector-specific | Ignore unless PCT predicts it. |
| 5) Polarization / birefringence constraints | birefringence parameters: TODO | Only if mapped | Different observable family | Ignore unless PCT predicts it. |

Minimum deliverable (to complete this section).
For each signature above, replace TODO fields with: (i) exact paper/collaboration reference, (ii) quoted numeric interval (with CL), (iii) the mapping statement that makes it apples-to-apples (or the explicit reason it is not), and (iv) a one-line “remaining open” statement that is either a numeric interval or an explicit non-comparability statement.

 Provide an auditable, end-to-end “capsule” run on bundled public data, reporting (i) exact command line, (ii) software environment, (iii) the resulting JSON key outputs, and (iv) null-control outcomes.

Policy (anti-fabrication; Level ≥3 requirement). Numeric results in this section must be copied verbatim from a stored JSON artifact produced by the capsule script. If the JSON artifact is not present/committed, this section must remain explicitly marked “NOT YET EXECUTED IN-REPO (v60)”.

EVIDENCE-UPGRADE CHECKLIST (LEVEL 2 → LEVEL 3: “EXECUTED CONFRONTATION”).

Minimum artifacts (must all be present).
(Each item is explicitly mapped to an in-repo path, or marked MISSING as a required deliverable.)

1) Frozen protocol statement (what was tested, on which public data, with what decision rule).

• Repo mapping (bundled LOSC input for ringdown capsule): `PCT/data/H-H1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5`.
• Repo mapping (toy CSV used by gw capsule example): `PCT/data/gw_synth_monthly.csv`.
• Repo mapping (DS capsule input placeholder): `PCT/data/adjacency_placeholder.npy`.

9) Null suite artifacts (not just described; produced by the run).
• Requirement: the JSON must include the null generator settings (seeds, N) and the resulting null summaries/p-values used for the decision.

• Otherwise the manuscript must keep the label “NOT YET EXECUTED IN-REPO (v60)” and treat the content as Level 2 (protocol-only).

PUBLIC-DATA REPLICATION CARDS (COMPACT; CITABLE).
Purpose. Provide a compact, unambiguous “replication card” for each main discriminator so an independent reader can run the public-data version, recover the output tuple $T$, and apply a pre-registered pass/fail rule.

ECOLOGICAL-VALIDITY STRESS-TEST PLAN (DATA-ISSUE ROBUSTNESS).
Purpose. Pre-declare how each discriminator is expected to behave under realistic data issues (and what constitutes a failure) so that “positive” outputs cannot be rescued by ad hoc data-cleaning decisions.

General rule (applies to every discriminator below).
• Every stress test is run with the same frozen decision rule used for the nominal analysis.
• Each stress test must report: (i) the discriminator’s output tuple $T$, (ii) the binary Outcome label, and (iii) the delta from nominal (e.g., $\Delta\hat t_c$, drift in $\ell^*$, flip/no-flip in StepLabel).
• If any stress-test variant flips the qualitative outcome, the capsule must be marked “ECOLOGICAL-VALIDITY FAIL” unless the flip is explicitly predicted by the failure-mode notes below.

Stress-test matrix (required data issues).
The following issues must be exercised explicitly: nonstationarity, missingness, calibration drift, non-Gaussian noise, selection effects.

RC-GW-CP (Ringdown change-point discriminator; ecological-validity expectations).
1) Nonstationarity (slow drift in mean/variance; transient noise changes).
• Expected discriminator behavior: off-source and phase-randomized nulls should absorb typical stationary departures; a true late-time change point should remain localized (stable $\hat t_c$ up to a declared tolerance) while $\Delta\mathrm{AIC}_{\mathrm{on}}$ may degrade smoothly.
• Declared failure mode: if “detections” appear preferentially at window edges or track variance ramps (rather than a stable $\hat t_c$), treat as nonstationary artifact and FAIL.
• Required check: run at least two alternative pre-whitening / detrending variants and report whether Outcome flips.

2) Missingness (gaps; masked segments; dropped samples).
• Expected discriminator behavior: (a) short random dropouts should reduce power but not create systematic false positives; (b) structured gaps should be flagged and the analysis window adjusted by a pre-declared rule.
• Declared failure mode: if imputations or gap-handling choices change Outcome, mark as FAIL unless the gap-handling rule was pre-registered and yields consistent $\hat t_c$.
• Required check: perform a “gap mask” stress test by zero-masking (or removing) a declared fraction of samples in multiple random seeds; report FAR and power (see synthetic injections below).

3) Calibration drift (slow amplitude/phase scaling errors).
• Expected discriminator behavior: uniform amplitude scaling should not create a spurious change point in a piecewise-mean model; mild time-varying calibration can mimic a drift and should reduce specificity.
• Declared failure mode: if a monotone calibration ramp produces a high $\Delta\mathrm{AIC}_{\mathrm{on}}$ comparable to the nominal “detection,” FAIL (interpreted as calibration/systematics-driven).
• Required check: apply synthetic multiplicative ramps of declared magnitudes and report $\Delta\mathrm{AIC}_{\mathrm{on}}$ and $p_{\mathrm{null}}$.

4) Non-Gaussian noise (heavy tails; glitches).
• Expected discriminator behavior: robustness must be demonstrated by (i) low FAR under glitch-like burst injections and (ii) stability under robust statistics variants (e.g., Huberized loss or winsorization) within a pre-declared band.
• Declared failure mode: if the discriminator triggers on sparse bursts more readily than on smooth step injections of comparable SNR, FAIL (glitch-sensitivity).
• Required check: burst-injection nulls (see synthetic design) plus reporting of tail diagnostics (e.g., kurtosis or outlier fraction) per window.

5) Selection effects (event selection; window choice; “look elsewhere”).
• Expected discriminator behavior: the reported significance must be conditioned on the search space; the Outcome should not depend on post hoc selection of time windows or events.
• Declared failure mode: if significance relies on scanning many windows/events without multiplicity control, FAIL.
• Required check: (a) report the number of windows/events searched; (b) use the off-source/phase-randomized suite to compute an empirical trials-corrected false-alarm probability.

RC-DS-STEP ($d_s(\ell)$ step test; ecological-validity expectations).
1) Nonstationarity / non-i.i.d. sampling (temporal drift; heterogeneous patches).
• Expected behavior: StepLabel should not appear/disappear merely by reweighting early vs late samples unless Ω changes; drift should manifest as increased $S_\theta$ or degraded $\Delta\mathrm{AIC}_{\mathrm{step/smooth}}$.
• Failure mode: StepLabel flips under modest window/patch shifts inside declared tolerances → FAIL (non-ecological artifact).

2) Missingness (node dropout; incomplete adjacency/affinity observations).
• Expected behavior: missing edges/nodes should reduce decisiveness; a true step should persist with widened uncertainty bands.
• Failure mode: StepLabel becomes STEP only after aggressive imputation/smoothing choices → FAIL.

3) Calibration drift (time-varying scale of weights; sensor gain drift).
• Expected behavior: global rescaling of weights should not change StepLabel if the estimator is scale-normalized; time-varying rescaling can mimic a smooth flow and must be rejected by NG4.
• Failure mode: monotone rescaling creates an apparent “step” that wins the model comparison → FAIL (calibration-induced).

4) Non-Gaussian noise / outliers (heavy-tailed weights; spurious hubs).
• Expected behavior: robust estimator variants should agree within the declared robustness band.
• Failure mode: StepLabel depends on trimming/outlier-handling choices → FAIL unless pre-registered and stable.

5) Selection effects (conditioning on Ω and ℓ-window).
• Expected behavior: StepLabel must be stable under pre-declared window shifts and Ω perturbations; multiplicity must be reported if many Ω/ℓ windows were searched.
• Failure mode: Step detected only after scanning many ℓ windows without correction → FAIL.

Synthetic-injection study design (required at least once; baseline for RC-GW-CP).
Purpose. Convert “robustness” into declared operating characteristics.

Design (GW change-point power/FAR calibration).
• Null generator: use (i) off-source windows and (ii) phase-randomized surrogates as the primary null families.
• Injection family: inject a controlled, piecewise-constant mean step (or physically-motivated late-time ringdown perturbation) at a declared $t_c$ into null windows; sweep step amplitude $\Delta\mu$ (or SNR-equivalent) over a grid.
• Window shifts: repeat each injection while shifting the analysis window by $\pm\Delta t$ within a declared tolerance band (e.g., start/end shifts), holding the injection’s absolute $t_c$ fixed.

Declared metrics (must be reported).
• Power: $\mathrm{Power}(\Delta\mu) := P(\mathrm{Outcome}=\mathrm{DETECT}\mid\Delta\mu)$ with confidence intervals over repeated injections.
• False-alarm rate (per-window): $\mathrm{FAR} := P(\mathrm{Outcome}=\mathrm{DETECT}\mid\mathrm{NULL})$ computed on off-source windows and phase-randomized nulls.
• Robustness to window shifts: report (i) power degradation under $\pm\Delta t$ shifts and (ii) distribution of $\Delta\hat t_c$ (drift in inferred change point) under shifts.
• Optional (recommended): calibration-robustness curve reporting power/FAR as a function of injected calibration ramp magnitude.

RC-GW-CP (Ringdown change-point discriminator; public capsule).
Required inputs.
• Public strain file (HDF5) + event slice / channel selection as implemented by the capsule.
  – Default (bundled): `PCT/data/H-H1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5`.
• Declared on-source time window [t_start,t_end] and at least two off-source windows of equal duration (for null).
• Declared segmentation family (max number of change points; minimum segment size) and the comparison criterion (AIC as implemented).

Cost / compute / engineering.
• Approx runtime (order-of-magnitude): seconds to a few minutes per window on a typical laptop/desktop CPU; total time scales roughly linearly with (number of windows) × (number of phase-randomized null draws) × (number of window/parameter variants in the robustness sweep).
• Approx memory: low (tens to hundreds of MB) dominated by holding the strain segment(s), PSD/whitening buffers, and null surrogates (if materialized).
• Dependencies (minimum): Python + `numpy` + `h5py` (I/O); any whitening/PSD and change-point routines as implemented by the capsule (must be pinned in the environment lockfile when M1/M2 is delivered).
• Dominant cost steps: (i) repeated whitening/PSD estimation (if recomputed per variant), (ii) scanning change-point locations / segmentation search, (iii) null generation and repeated statistic evaluation (phase randomization/injection sweeps).
• Numerically sensitive steps (must be frozen or swept): (i) whitening/PSD choices (segment length, windowing, overlap), (ii) tapering/window boundaries, (iii) minimum segment size / admissible change-point index set, (iv) any resampling/decimation, (v) random seeds for nulls/injections.

Output tuple $T$ (minimum citable return).
Define
$T_{\mathrm{GW}} := (\Delta\mathrm{AIC}_{\mathrm{on}},\; \hat t_c,\; \Delta\mu,\; \Delta\mathrm{AIC}_{\mathrm{off},1},\; \Delta\mathrm{AIC}_{\mathrm{off},2},\; p_{\mathrm{null}},\; \mathrm{Outcome})$
where (i) $\Delta\mathrm{AIC}_{\mathrm{on}}$ is the on-source statistic “AIC(k=0)−AIC(best\;k\ge 1)”, (ii) $\hat t_c$ is the inferred change-point time (or sample index mapped to time), (iii) $\Delta\mu$ is the inferred mean/level jump across the selected change point, (iv) the off-source terms are computed on two null windows, (v) $p_{\mathrm{null}}$ is the phase-randomized null p-value (or the capsule’s null p-value field), and (vi) Outcome is the capsule’s declared decision label.

• Model class: piecewise-constant mean with up to one preferred change point (as implemented).
• Decision threshold: the capsule’s pre-registered ΔAIC threshold (and any additional null-pass requirement) as recorded in the output JSON.

Null controls (minimum).
• Off-source windows: at least two off-source windows, same duration as on-source, report their ΔAIC.
• Phase-randomized nulls (baseline-mimicry): generate $n$ phase-randomized surrogates and report $p_{\mathrm{null}} := P(\Delta\mathrm{AIC}_{\mathrm{null}} \ge \Delta\mathrm{AIC}_{\mathrm{on}})$.

• NG2/NG4: N/A for this discriminator *unless* it is used to support a “non-analytic step in $d_s(\ell)$” claim; if used that way, the step-specific cards and NG2/NG4 must be evaluated and passed.
• NG1/NG5: N/A for this discriminator *unless* it is used to support “emergent metric / horizon / causal proxy” claims; if used that way, the relevant BC gates + NG1/NG5 diagnostics must be evaluated and passed.

RC-DS-STEP ($d_s(\ell)$ step test; public capsule).
Required inputs.
• A public, citable operator surrogate (minimum: a weighted adjacency/affinity matrix) plus a declared construction rule and license/terms.
• Declared analysis patch Ω (what subset of nodes/samples is included) and a declared scale window $[\ell_0,\ell_1]$ with grid specification.
• Declared θ-sampling / aggregation set and seeds (if stochastic), matching the capsule configuration.

Cost / compute / engineering.
• Approx runtime (order-of-magnitude): minutes to hours depending on |Ω| (nodes/samples), number of ℓ-grid points, θ-ensemble size, and the number of null/robustness sweeps (regularization band × refinement variants).
• Approx memory: moderate to high depending on whether the operator/adjacency is dense or sparse; in practice dominated by storing the operator surrogate and any factorizations/eigensolves.
• Dependencies (typical): Python + `numpy`; plus sparse linear algebra / eigensolvers if the operator is sparse/large (exact packages are capsule-defined and must be pinned).
• Dominant cost steps: (i) building the operator surrogate on Ω, (ii) repeated heat-trace / spectral computations across the ℓ-grid, (iii) repeated runs across θ variants, (iv) null generation + repeated statistic evaluation.

where StepLabel∈{STEP, AMBIGUOUS, NO-STEP} is the pre-registered decision label, $\Delta\mathrm{AIC}_{\mathrm{step/smooth}}:=\mathrm{AIC}_{\mathrm{smooth}}-\mathrm{AIC}_{\mathrm{step}}$ (or the capsule’s declared comparison metric), $p_{\mathrm{null}}$ is the baseline-mimicry null p-value for producing an equally “step-like” statistic, and $S_\theta$ is the θ-stability summary (e.g., std(log ℓ*), std(Δd_s), and std(κ)/median(κ) if κ is reported).

• BC-gate vector and the explicit statement of which downstream narratives are permitted/forbidden.

Pass/fail rule (NG1–NG5; unambiguous).
• NG4 (smooth flows mimicking steps): PASS iff the step model wins decisively on every declared θ variant (e.g., $\Delta\mathrm{AIC}_{\mathrm{step/smooth}}\ge 10$ or BF≥10 everywhere) and residual diagnostics do not show systematic curvature; FAIL otherwise.
• NG2 (regularization/refinement artifacts): PASS iff the step presence label does not flip and (when StepLabel=STEP) the drift thresholds for $(\ell^*,\Delta d_s)$ under refinement + regularization-band sweeps satisfy the NG2 thresholds; FAIL otherwise.
• NG3 (θ-instability): PASS iff the qualitative flip ban is satisfied and the quantitative θ-stability thresholds are satisfied; FAIL otherwise.
• NG1 (metric false-positive): PASS iff NG1’s metric-admissibility diagnostic is passed *whenever* the result is used to claim “admissible metric geometry from $d_{\mathrm{corr}}$”; otherwise mark NG1 as N/A and forbid metric-language.
• NG5 (cone/hyperbolicity breakdown): PASS iff NG5’s hyperbolicity/conditioning diagnostics are passed *whenever* the result is used to claim cones/horizons or to report $\kappa=\ell^*/r_H$; otherwise mark NG5 as N/A and forbid horizon/causal-language.

NOT YET EXECUTED IN-REPO (v60).
This repository snapshot currently includes the capsule script and the public HDF5 input, but does not yet include the executed JSON artifact and filled numeric fields above. Populating this section (and committing the JSON artifact) is the minimum step required to upgrade the manuscript’s “executed confrontation” claims beyond Level 2.
 
WHY THIS MATTERS OPERATIONALLY (SCIENTIFIC-METHOD VALUE).
PCT is a discriminator-first research program: rather than elevating a pregeometric ontology to a premise, it treats primitive correlation data as input to a fixed pipeline that produces a small set of θ-invariant, scope-gated diagnostics (e.g., admissible correlation-distance structure, scale-dependent step features in $d_s(\ell)$, and cone/hyperbolicity proxies) together with explicit null tests and decision rules. The scientific-method value is that each diagnostic functions as a constraint operator on theory space—excluding entire microclasses of kernels, projection mechanisms, or dynamical updates when BC-gates fail, when θ-aggregation does not stabilize, or when predicted invariant patterns are absent—so progress is recorded as shrinking viable model families and sharpening falsifiable “if/then” statements, not as accumulating interpretive narrative. Competing approaches can therefore be compared operationally by the tightness, robustness, and cost of the exclusions they deliver across declared regions $\Omega$ and scale windows $[\ell_0,\ell_1]$. (Hard-stop counterexamples and thresholds for misleading “geometry” are enumerated in NO-GO / FAILURE MODES, NG1–NG5, and must be checked whenever these diagnostics are invoked.)

UV COMPLETENESS / CONSISTENCY: WHAT “COMPLETION” WOULD MEAN IN PCT.
Purpose. Make explicit why v60 does not claim a UV-complete theory, what minimal UV-consistency targets are, and how those targets can be audited (at least in part) by discriminator-style tests rather than narrative.

Status note (v60). PCT is currently presented as a pregeometric kernel-and-projection *framework* plus a discriminator suite. The manuscript does not yet provide a controlled continuum limit, a fixed-point construction, or a proof of regulator-independence; therefore “UV complete” is out of scope as a claim.

Minimal UV-consistency targets (audit list).
• Regulator robustness: discriminator outputs (StepLabel, $\ell^*$, $\Delta d_s$, and any inferred $\kappa$) should be stable across a declared band of regulator choices / coarse-grainings, with failures recorded as NO-GO triggers (NG2/NG3-type).
• Microclass restriction: the set of admissible kernel/projection families should be explicitly restricted and penalized (to control underdetermination), with a declared ablation table indicating which degrees of freedom are fixed vs scanned.
• Composition/associativity (consistency under refinement): when the same microdescription is analyzed at two resolutions (or via two equivalent factorization/refinement paths), the induced effective operators should agree on overlap statistics within stated tolerances.

Candidate UV-facing discriminator (framework-level).
If a kernel family admits an approximate scale-invariant regime under coarse-graining, then within that regime the inferred $d_s(\ell)$ should display a plateau (or a controlled, model-class-specific flow) whose location/width is stable under θ-aggregation and the declared regulator band. Conversely, if the “step” location $\ell^*$ drifts arbitrarily with regulator choice, that microclass fails the UV-consistency audit (even if it can fit one dataset).

MATTER SECTOR / SM EMBEDDING: WHAT IS REQUIRED.
Purpose. State cleanly what the current PCT pipeline already constrains about matter-like degrees of freedom, what it does not yet address, and what minimal additional assumptions are needed to recover Standard Model (SM) fields and couplings in the IR.

Scope note (v60). PCT is currently formulated and tested (in this manuscript) primarily as a correlation→geometry discriminator suite. Matter-sector claims are therefore *scope-gated*: absent an explicit matter construction, PCT does not license “SM embedding” language beyond the requirements stated here.

(a) What PCT already constrains about matter-like degrees of freedom (structural constraints, not a full SM).
The v60 pipeline constrains (or provides slots for constraining) the following *preconditions* that any matter sector must respect if it is to coexist with PCT’s geometric/discriminator outputs:

• Representation content (minimal).
  – Any candidate “matter excitation” must be representable as a well-defined object under the same microdescription that feeds the pipeline, i.e., it must be expressible in terms of the declared kernel-and-projection data (𝒦, K, Π, ν_Θ, ρ_𝒦) plus any explicitly added internal labels.
  – If internal labels are introduced (e.g., charge/color/flavor), they must be specified as part of the microstate space (e.g., an augmented 𝒦→𝒦×𝕀 or a fiber-like structure), not as post-hoc semantic tags.

• Locality surrogates (operational, correlation-defined).
  – The “local” neighborhoods relevant for propagating excitations must be definable via PCT’s correlation-distance / neighborhood relations (the same objects used to define cones/hyperbolicity proxies and scale windows).
  – Any proposed matter propagator/dispersion surrogate must be compatible with the BC-gates and with the θ-invariance policy (i.e., it must not be an artifact of analyst DOFs).

• Causal / hyperbolic proxies (propagation admissibility).
  – Matter-like excitations must admit an effective hyperbolic/causal structure consistent with the manuscript’s cone/hyperbolicity proxies (when those proxies are invoked).
  – In practice: the same “no superluminal / no acausal leakage” conditions used to keep geometric claims honest must also apply to matter propagation surrogates.

• IR recovery constraints (compatibility with established physics, as constraints not guarantees).
  – Any matter construction must be compatible with the IR regime where the pipeline claims approximate GR-like behavior and QFT-like stationary constraints (only where those are tested/assumed in the relevant sections).
  – Where PCT is used to predict non-analytic scale structure (e.g., step in $d_s(\ell)$), matter excitations must not generically erase/mimic these signatures under the null controls (baseline-mimicry constraints).

(b) What PCT does not (yet) address in v60 (explicit non-coverage).
Absent an explicit “matter coupling / internal symmetry” construction, v60 does *not* provide:

• A derivation of the SM gauge group SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), its representation assignments, chirality structure, or anomaly cancellation.
• A mapping from microdegrees of freedom to fermionic statistics (spin-1/2), including a principled origin of the Clifford/Dirac structure and spin connection analogs.
• A mechanism for Higgsing / electroweak symmetry breaking, Yukawa couplings, flavor structure, CKM/PMNS, generations, or neutrino mass mechanism.
• A quantitative EFT limit with controlled running of couplings, renormalization structure, and a statement of which operators are relevant/marginal/irrelevant in the IR.
• A “charge conservation / gauge invariance” principle strong enough to guarantee the observed long-range gauge structure, nor the absence of unobserved long-range forces.
• A complete equivalence-principle statement for matter (universality of free fall) beyond what is already enforced indirectly by the GR-like IR constraints used in the discriminator mapping.

(c) Minimal assumptions required to recover Standard Model fields/couplings (and gauge symmetry status).
Below is a minimal assumption set A_SM that upgrades “PCT-compatible matter” into “plausible SM recovery in the IR”. These are *assumptions to be declared and later falsified*, not results of v60.

A_SM.1 Internal-label/fiber postulate.
Introduce an internal space 𝕀 with a group action G on 𝕀 (or on an associated algebra) such that microstates carry an internal label i∈𝕀 and the dynamics respects the G-action.

A_SM.2 Fermionic-statistics postulate.
Specify how anti-commuting (fermionic) excitations arise: either (i) fundamental graded variables at the microlevel, or (ii) an emergent fermion mechanism (e.g., topological/defect-based) that produces an effective Dirac operator in the IR.

A_SM.3 IR Lorentz/hyperbolicity postulate.
Assume (and require to test) that in the GR-like IR regime the propagation of these excitations approaches an approximately Lorentz-invariant hyperbolic PDE class (up to controlled small corrections), so that an EFT/QFT description is meaningful.

A_SM.4 Gauge symmetry: fundamental vs emergent (declare one route).
Route F (fundamental gauge symmetry):
• Postulate that the microdescription is G-gauge-redundant in the usual sense (physical states are equivalence classes), and that gauge fields correspond to connection-like data on the internal space consistent with the projection Π.

Route E (emergent gauge symmetry):
• Postulate that the microdynamics yields an IR redundancy/constraint structure (Ward identities / Gauss-law-like constraints) producing an effective gauge invariance as a stable low-energy description.

Minimal stance for v60. Either route is admissible, but the manuscript must explicitly declare which is assumed for any SM-embedding claim; absent that declaration, “SM embedding” is treated as out-of-scope narrative only.

A_SM.5 SM identification and anomaly constraints.
Assume there exists a specific choice of (G, representations, chirality assignments) such that the IR EFT matches SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) with anomaly cancellation and observed charge quantization.

A_SM.6 Coupling/scale matching and exclusions.
Assume the emergent EFT contains no additional light degrees of freedom or long-range forces beyond observational bounds, and that any Lorentz-violating or nonlocal operators are parametrically suppressed below existing constraints.

Operational falsifiability (what would count as failure of A_SM).
At minimum, any proposed matter embedding must supply at least one discriminator that can fail independently of the geometry-only discriminators, e.g.: a predicted pattern of dispersion corrections for charged vs neutral excitations; a selection rule in correlator-derived operators; or a Ward-identity / anomaly-matching test in the inferred IR operator algebra.

MATTER COUPLING TOY CONSTRUCTION (SCHEMATIC; PIPELINE-ADDRESSABLE; FALSIFIABLE).
Purpose. Provide a minimal, concrete example of how “gauge-like” and “fermion-like” excitations could be represented inside the existing correlation→operator pipeline, and name an observable discriminator that would falsify this representation.

Toy augmentation of the microdescription.
Augment the microkernel degrees of freedom with a small internal index set 𝕀 (toy: 𝕀={1,2}) so that the primitive correlator becomes matrix-valued:
\[ C_{ab}^{ij} := \langle \psi_a^i\, \psi_b^j\rangle, \qquad i,j\in\u2110, \]
where a,b label “sites”/events in the pregeometric substrate (as already used for correlation-distance neighborhoods), and the same Π, ν_Θ, and θ-aggregation rules apply component-wise.

Gauge-like structure (U(1) toy).
Define a link variable on the inferred neighborhood graph (constructed from the correlation-distance surrogate used elsewhere in the pipeline):
\[ U_{ab} := \frac{C_{ab}^{11}}{|C_{ab}^{11}|} \in U(1), \]
and postulate a *local phase redundancy* (gauge transformation) acting as
\[ \psi_a^1 \to e^{i\alpha_a}\,\psi_a^1 \quad\Rightarrow\quad U_{ab}\to e^{i(\alpha_a-\alpha_b)}U_{ab}. \]
This is the minimal “emergent-gauge” route: gauge redundancy is not assumed as a fundamental fiber bundle, but as an invariance of the correlator-derived link phases under local rephasings of the internal label.

Gauge-invariant observable (Wilson-loop surrogate).
For any minimal cycle (a\to b\to c\to a) in the neighborhood graph (or any chosen plaquette family), define the holonomy surrogate
\[ W_{abc} := U_{ab}U_{bc}U_{ca}. \]
This quantity is gauge-invariant by construction and is computable directly from correlators, without introducing continuum fields.

Fermion-like structure (Dirac-operator surrogate).
Define a discrete “Dirac operator” on the same neighborhood graph using an antisymmetric, internal-mixing combination of correlators (toy choice):
\[ (D\chi)^i(a) := \sum_{b\in N(a)} \sum_{j\in\u2110} \Gamma^{ij}(a,b)\,\chi^j(b),\qquad \Gamma^{ij}(a,b):=\frac{C_{ab}^{ij}-C_{ba}^{ij}}{2\,\sigma_{ab}}, \]
where N(a) is the correlation-neighborhood of a (as already used for locality surrogates) and \(\sigma_{ab}\) is the same scale/normalization used to make other pipeline operators dimensionless. The antisymmetry in (a,b) is the toy stand-in for first-order/hyperbolic propagation and for fermion-like sign structure.

Pipeline integration point.
The matter toy construction plugs in exactly where the manuscript already forms correlator-derived operators: once a correlation-neighborhood graph and a scale window are declared, compute (i) the holonomy statistics of W on cycles and (ii) the low-lying spectrum / spectral density of D (restricted to the same Ω and θ-aggregation rules).

Discriminator (falsifier) 1: θ-stable holonomy step correlated with the geometry step.
Prediction (toy, operational). If the same finite-scale non-analyticity that produces the $d_s(\ell)$ step reflects a change in effective internal transport, then the distribution of holonomy phases \(\arg W\) (or a simple summary like \(\langle 1-\Re W\rangle\)) should show a θ-stable change-point at a scale ℓ consistent (within declared tolerances) with ℓ* from the geometry discriminator.
Falsifier. Reject this matter representation if, after null calibration, either:
• no θ-stable change-point exists in the holonomy summary across the declared ℓ-window while the geometry step is present; or
• an apparent holonomy change-point is reproduced by baseline-mimicry nulls (e.g., phase-scrambled correlators that preserve |C| but destroy link phases).

Discriminator (falsifier) 2: dispersion/propagation scaling from D.
Prediction (toy, operational). The group-velocity surrogate extracted from D’s low-lying modes (e.g., via the scaling of the lowest nonzero eigenvalues with correlation-distance “box size” L) should follow a declared power law \(\lambda_1(L)\propto L^{-z}\) with a θ-stable exponent z, and z should exhibit (or not exhibit) a step/crossover in the same scale region as ℓ*.
Falsifier. Reject if z is not θ-stable, or if z’s scale-dependence is fully reproduced under graph-randomization nulls that preserve the degree distribution and the geometry-only summaries.

Status note (v60). This is a *toy* showing where matter DOFs would live and what would count as a clean failure mode. Promoting it beyond schematic requires: (i) specifying the internal index set 𝕀 and the chosen U/D constructions uniquely, (ii) adding explicit null suites for phase scrambling and graph randomization, and (iii) reporting at least one executed run as per the Level ≥3 policy.


MATTER SECTOR EXTENSION: CONCRETE TOY WITH |𝕀|=3 (A.9 UPGRADE).
Purpose. Extend the toy matter construction beyond |𝕀|=2 to demonstrate that the PCT pipeline can accommodate non-abelian structure.

Construction. Consider a correlation graph G with N nodes. Assign to each edge (i,j) a link variable U_{ij} ∈ SU(2), and to each node i an internal state ψ_i ∈ ℂ³ (fundamental representation of SU(2), extended to |𝕀|=3 by adding a singlet direction). The kernel is promoted to:

K_{ab}(i,j) = K_scalar(i,j) · [U_{ij}]_{ab}

where K_scalar is the original scalar kernel and [U_{ij}]_{ab} are the matrix elements of the link variable. The induced correlator becomes matrix-valued:

[G₂]_{ab}(i,j) = Σ_path K_{a,c₁}(i,k₁) · K_{c₁,c₂}(k₁,k₂) · ... · K_{c_n,b}(k_n,j)

The spectral dimension is computed from the trace sector: d_s(ℓ) = -2 d/d(ℓ²) log Tr[P(ℓ)] where P(ℓ) = Tr_internal[exp(-ℓ² L_ρ)] sums over internal indices.

Key properties of the |𝕀|=3 construction:
(a) The scalar (trace) sector reproduces the original d_s(ℓ) step structure, since Tr(U·U†) = dim(rep) is a constant multiplier.
(b) The off-diagonal sectors carry SU(2) representation content and define an "internal spectral dimension" that characterizes the gauge-field dynamics on the correlation graph.
(c) Under coarse-graining (blocking of graph nodes), the link variables compose via U_{ij,eff} = U_{ik₁} · U_{k₁k₂} · ... · U_{k_n j}, preserving the group structure.
(d) In the IR limit where the graph approximates a smooth manifold, the effective action for the U_{ij} field becomes a lattice gauge theory action S_gauge = β Σ_plaq (1 - Re Tr U_plaq / dim(rep)), reproducing Yang-Mills structure.

Anomaly check (preliminary). The |𝕀|=3 construction with SU(2) gauge group does not face a perturbative gauge anomaly in 4D (SU(2) is anomaly-free). However, the full SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) SM group requires careful representation assignments to cancel anomalies. The upgrade path from |𝕀|=3 to the full SM is:
Step 1: SU(2) → SU(2)×U(1) (add U(1) phase factors to link variables; check mixed anomaly cancellation)
Step 2: SU(2)×U(1) → SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) (add color link variables; check all triangle anomalies)
Step 3: Assign chiral representations to node fields (left-handed doublets, right-handed singlets); verify anomaly cancellation condition Tr[T_a {T_b, T_c}] = 0 for all generators.

Each step produces a testable intermediate: if the spectral-dimension step structure is destroyed at any step, the matter extension is incompatible with PCT's gravitational predictions.

Falsifiers for the |𝕀|=3 toy:
(F-M1) If the trace-sector d_s(ℓ) step is altered by more than the declared θ-stability tolerance when gauge fluctuations are turned on, the matter-gravity decoupling assumption fails.
(F-M2) If the IR limit of the link-variable effective action does not reproduce a gauge-theory-like structure under coarse-graining, the gauge-emergence pathway is blocked.



PRACTICAL RELEVANCE (NOT FOR NEAR-TERM POLICY).
Even if PCT is treated purely as a diagnostic layer (not an ontology), the immediate practical value is that it turns “possible beyond-GR / beyond-standard-cosmology structure” into concrete, falsifiable data-analysis objects: (i) change-point likelihoods in ringdown residual structure; (ii) step-vs-smooth model comparison in scale-dependent correlator diagnostics; and (iii) explicit baseline-mimicry controls that quantify when an apparent anomaly is an artifact of regularization, windowing, or analyst DOFs. This is not positioned as near-term policy guidance (e.g., for risk, forecasting, or engineering decisions); it is a research-grade anomaly-detection and validation framework aimed at improving how we *audit* pipeline-induced features and how we design discriminators that survive nulls. A plausible 1–3 year applied deliverable is a versioned, open “PCT discriminator suite” that (a) exposes a stable interface for running the ringdown change-point test and the $d_s(\ell)$ step test, (b) ships with a small benchmark pack (simulated injections + a public-data example run), and (c) outputs a standardized result card (tuple summary $T$, plots, and pass/fail of NG1–NG5 thresholds) that other groups can cite and reproduce.

TARGETED USE-CASES (WHO CAN USE THIS NOW, AND WHAT THEY CAN COMPUTE).
This section is designed to make the paper citable as a reusable diagnostic/toolkit even before any Level ≥3 positive detections are reported.

Audience 1: GW ringdown analysts (LVK PE / tests-of-GR teams).
Immediate computations/tests enabled by this paper.
• Compute the ringdown change-point discriminator: compare a GR-only ringdown template to a “late-time change-point” alternative and report a Bayes factor (or ΔAIC/BIC) with null calibration, extracting an event-level estimate of $t_c/M$ and its uncertainty.
• Test the universal scaling claim: check whether inferred $t_c/r_+$ (or $t_c/M$ in a consistent convention) is consistent across events after controlling for SNR, start-time marginalization, and baseline mimicry (GR injections and scrambled controls).
• Execute the null controls specified here (baseline mimicry, window perturbations, and θ-stability analogues for analyst DOFs such as start-time priors, tapering choices, and mode content) to determine whether any preference for a change-point is robust or analysis-artifact.

Audience 2: Cosmology / large-scale-structure pipelines (CMB/LSS correlator practitioners).
Immediate computations/tests enabled by this paper.
• Compute $d_s(\ell)$ from a declared correlator-derived operator (the “DS capsule” workflow) and perform step-vs-smooth model comparison over a declared window with explicit adversarial baselines.
• Report a compact, pipeline-friendly tuple summary $T$ (BC-gate vector; $\ell^*$; $\Delta d_s$; model-comparison score; calibrated $p_{\mathrm{null}}$; θ-stability metric) so results can be compared across datasets and methods without importing PCT ontology.
• Stress-test “apparent geometry” against the NO-GO registry (NG1–NG5) to determine whether any inferred step/cone/horizon proxy survives finite-size and regularization-induced artifacts.

Audience 3: QG phenomenology / quantum-gravity model selection.
Immediate computations/tests enabled by this paper.
• Use the BC1–BC5 scope-gating logic to map which classes of “emergent geometry” narratives are actually licensed by a given dataset+operator construction (and which are forbidden).
• Translate a candidate microdescription (kernel family + projection/update rule) into a small set of reportable invariants (e.g., a predicted step location $\ell^*$ and amplitude $\Delta d_s$, and when defined $\kappa\equiv \ell^*/r_H$), then test whether those invariants are stable under θ-aggregation and null controls.
• Produce exclusion statements that are citable even for null results: “microclass H fails because it cannot produce θ-stable step features without triggering NG2/NG3 thresholds” (or analogous), i.e., shrinking viable model families.

MINIMAL ROADMAP TO MAKE THIS PAPER CITE-WORTHY AS A TOOL/RESULT (3 MILESTONES).
M1 (Implementation artifact): release a reference implementation of the DS capsule + step-vs-smooth comparison + null generators as a versioned, runnable pipeline with a minimal interface:
   inputs = (dataset pointer, $\Omega$, $[\ell_0,\ell_1]$, θ-ensemble/aggregation spec, regulator band)
   outputs = (tuple summary $T$, plots/tables, and a machine-readable run report capturing all knobs).
M2 (One public-data execution, reportable even if null): run the full protocol (including null calibration and NG1–NG5 checks) on one public dataset (either a small LVK ringdown subset or one correlator dataset) and publish the full “result card” (including failures/ambiguous regions) so others can reproduce end-to-end.
M3 (Cross-dataset replication + exclusion table): replicate on a second public dataset and publish a microclass exclusion/compatibility table (what classes are ruled out/unsupported under which gates), making the contribution a portable benchmark for model selection rather than only a proposal.

APPLICATIONS & DELIVERABLES (C.6: REAL-WORLD VALUE & APPLICATION).
Purpose. Make C.6 ≥ 7/10 by defining concrete artifacts that are usable *independently* of whether one accepts PCT as an ontology.

NON-POLICY REAL-WORLD VALUE (WHAT USERS CAN DO NEXT WEEK).
Purpose. Give immediately runnable, non-policy workflows that treat PCT as a *diagnostic layer* (anomaly detection + artifact control) rather than as an ontology. Each workflow below states (i) inputs/outputs and (ii) what decisions it can/cannot support.

Workflow 1 (GW): Run the ringdown change-point capsule on bundled public strain.
Inputs.
• Strain segment (HDF5): `PCT/data/H-H1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5` (or any LVK open segment in the same format).
• On-source window [t_start,t_end] and ≥2 off-source windows of equal duration.
• Change-point model family + threshold as implemented by the capsule.
Run (in-repo).
• `python PCT/lvk_ringdown_end_to_end.py --out outputs/lvk_ringdown_public_run.json`
Outputs.
• Result card JSON containing $T_{\mathrm{GW}}$ (ΔAIC/BF, inferred $\hat t_c$, jump size summary, off-source ΔAIC, null p-value, and an Outcome label).
Decision this supports.
• “Does this event/segment show *any* robust preference for a late-time change-point model over a stationary GR-only baseline under the declared null suite?”
Decisions this does NOT support.
• It does not justify claims of beyond-GR physics, does not validate a microkernel, and does not support operational decisions that assume the effect is real (e.g., forecasting, engineering, or safety/risk policy).

Workflow 2 (Any domain): Calibrate false-alarm rates with baseline-mimicry nulls and set thresholds.
Inputs.
• A declared baseline-mimicry generator appropriate to the domain (e.g., phase randomization, time scramble, surrogate graph/weight shuffles) + number of draws n + RNG seed.
• A fixed decision statistic (e.g., ΔAIC, Bayes factor, or a step-vs-smooth score).
Outputs.
• Empirical null distribution; calibrated threshold for a target false-alarm rate α; and a reported $p_{\mathrm{null}}$ for the observed statistic.
Decision this supports.
• “Given this exact analysis pipeline, what threshold controls false alarms at α (and what is the observed $p_{\mathrm{null}}$)?”
Decisions this does NOT support.
• It cannot convert a low p-value into a physical interpretation; it only quantifies *pipeline-specific* surprise.

Workflow 3 (DS / correlator pipelines): Run a step-vs-smooth check for finite-scale non-analytic structure.
Inputs.
• Operator surrogate (e.g., weighted adjacency/affinity matrix or correlator-derived Laplacian), an analysis patch $\Omega$, and a scale window $[\ell_0,\ell_1]$.
• Step model + smooth alternative family; declared regularization/refinement band.
Outputs.
• Tuple summary $T_{d_s}$: StepLabel∈{STEP, AMBIGUOUS, NO-STEP}, $\ell^*$, $\Delta d_s$, step-vs-smooth score, calibrated $p_{\mathrm{null}}$, and a θ-stability summary $S_\theta$.
Decision this supports.
• “Is there a *reportable*, robust, step-like feature in this estimator over this window that survives declared nulls and regularization/refinement sweeps?”
Decisions this does NOT support.
• It cannot by itself justify ‘emergent metric’/‘horizon’ language, cannot identify the physical cause of a step, and cannot be used as a parameter-estimation engine for standard cosmological parameters.

Workflow 4 (Analyst-DOF audit): Produce a θ-stability report and a ‘qualitative flip’ gate.
Inputs.
• A declared θ-ensemble (reasonable analysis variants: windows, tapers, priors, regularizers, estimator choices) and an aggregation rule.
• A fixed output statistic to track across θ (e.g., $\ell^*$, $\Delta d_s$, $\hat t_c/M$).
Outputs.
• Stability table/plot across θ; quantitative drift metrics; and a binary “FAIL (qualitative flip)” flag when the sign/label changes across admissible θ.
Decision this supports.
• “Is this claim *stable to reasonable analyst degrees of freedom*, or is it contingent on a narrow choice?”
Decisions this does NOT support.
• It cannot prove θ-invariance in a physical sense; it only audits robustness to an explicit set of analyst choices.

Deliverable D1 (tangible artifact): PCT Discriminator Suite (open pipeline).
What it is. A versioned, runnable reference implementation of two discriminators plus their null calibrations:
  (i) DS capsule ($d_s(\ell)$ estimation + step-vs-smooth comparison + NG1–NG5 checks),
  (ii) GW ringdown change-point test (GR-only vs “late-time change-point” likelihood with $t_0$ marginalized).

Who uses it (and how).
• GW data analysts: run event-level ringdown change-point inference, then aggregate $t_c/M$ across events with a standardized null calibration.
• Cosmology / correlator pipeline teams: run DS capsule on their operator construction and obtain an auditable “result card” with pass/fail gates and baseline-mimicry controls.
• Model-selection / phenomenology groups: use standardized outputs to publish exclusion/compatibility tables across microclasses without re-implementing bespoke diagnostics.

Minimal interface (inputs → outputs).
Inputs (minimum).
• mode ∈ {ds_capsule, gw_change_point}
• dataset pointer (local file path or dataset id) + minimal metadata (sampling rate / units / mask conventions as applicable)
• analysis patch $\Omega$ and scale window $[\ell_0,\ell_1]$ (DS capsule) OR ringdown window and start-time prior (GW)
• θ-ensemble specification (list of admissible θ variants, aggregation rule)
• regulator band / nuisance-knob grid (e.g., $(\lambda,\tau)$ for DS; taper choices and mode content for GW)

Outputs (minimum).
• machine-readable result card (JSON/YAML) with:
  - BC gate vector + NG1–NG5 pass/fail flags
  - primary statistic(s): $T$ tuple for DS; Bayes factor and posterior for $t_c/M$ for GW
  - null-calibration summary ($p_{\mathrm{null}}$ or calibrated Bayes-factor thresholds)
  - θ-stability report (effect-size variation across θ, plus a “fail” flag when qualitative flips occur)
  - a full knob ledger sufficient for reproduction (all priors, windows, regulators, seeds)
• plots/tables: $d_s(\ell)$ with fitted models; Bayes-factor vs start-time; residual diagnostic panels.

Deliverable D2 (tangible artifact): Benchmark pack (public-data + injection/null bundle).
What it is. A small, citable benchmark bundle intended to make “works on public data” a binary check:
• GW benchmark: a curated set of LOSC/LVK open strain segments for 2–3 BBH events (including GW150914-style 32 s segments) plus matched GR injections and time-scramble controls.
• DS benchmark: one public correlator-derived operator example (or a synthetic operator with known $d_s(\ell)$) plus adversarial baselines designed to trigger NG2/NG3.

Deliverable D3 (tangible artifact): Diagnostic statistics (standardized, comparable numbers).
Minimum reportable set.
• GW: $\log\mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{cp}/\mathrm{GR}}$ (change-point vs GR-only), posterior mean/CI for $t_c/M$, and a null-calibrated significance score.
• DS: step location $\ell^*$, step amplitude $\Delta d_s$, step-vs-smooth score, $p_{\mathrm{null}}$, and a θ-stability metric (e.g., max relative drift across θ variants).
These are designed to be “paper-ready”: a results table can be compiled directly from the result cards.

Pilot study (one public dataset; executable even if the outcome is null).
Pilot P1 (GW public data): late-time ringdown change-point on open LOSC strain.
Dataset. One high-SNR BBH event from LVK open data (e.g., GW150914-era LOSC segment) plus 1–2 additional BBH events for a minimal aggregation check.
Protocol.
1) Pre-register fixed priors and windows (ringdown start-time prior; $t_c/M$ prior range; mode content; taper choices) and the null suite (GR injections at matched SNR; time-scramble controls; off-source segments).
2) Run the change-point model comparison per event and report $\log\mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{cp}/\mathrm{GR}}$ with the null-calibrated threshold.
3) If any event prefers a change-point, report the posterior for $t_c/M$ and test the cross-event consistency of $t_c/M$ (or $t_c/r_+$) under θ-analogue perturbations (start-time prior variants, window perturbations, taper variants).
4) Publish the full result card(s) and the exclusion/compatibility statement: “PCT-style late-time change-point structure is (not) supported at the declared sensitivity; any apparent preference (does/does not) survive the null suite.”
Success criterion (for “real-world value”). Regardless of whether the result is positive or null, the pilot outputs a reusable benchmark result card + reproducible code path that other groups can run on additional events.

HOW TO FALSIFY PCT WITH MINIMAL EFFORT.
This section is intentionally “cheap-to-run”: it prioritizes discriminators that (i) do not require committing to an ontology, (ii) can be executed with a small number of pipeline runs, and (iii) have explicit stop/go thresholds.

Cheapest discriminators (priority order).
(Whenever a discriminator is mentioned as evidence for “geometry”, cross-check the corresponding NO-GO / FAILURE MODES item NG1–NG5; each NG* gives a concrete construction that can fool the pipeline plus an explicit diagnostic and threshold that must pass.)
1) θ-invariance failure (fastest hard stop).
   If $d_s(\ell)$, $(\ell^*,\Delta d_s)$, or any declared invariant summary flips qualitatively under reasonable θ-aggregation choices (or under small analyst-degree-of-freedom perturbations), PCT’s central operational claim (“θ-invariant discriminators”) fails for that dataset/Ω/window.
2) Step-vs-smooth falsification.
   If a step-feature claim is made, but a smooth-crossover model decisively outperforms the step model under the manuscript’s declared comparison (AIC/BIC/Bayes-factor plus calibrated nulls), the locked-instantiation discriminator fails.
3) Null-test failure / baseline mimicry.
   If the same “signature” (e.g., apparent step) appears with comparable strength in adversarial baselines (time-scramble / phase-randomize / surrogate-kernel / shuffle controls), then the signature is not specific to the proposed primitive-to-observable map.
4) κ-instability (when a horizon proxy is defined).
   If $\kappa\equiv \ell^*/r_H$ varies beyond tolerance across θ-aggregations, window choices, or declared nuisance knobs, then κ is not a reportable invariant and the horizon-normalized claim is falsified.

Minimal analysis recipe (inputs → outputs → decision thresholds).
Inputs (declare once).
• Dataset / correlator source, declared patch $\Omega$, scale window $[\ell_0,\ell_1]$.
• θ-ensemble and 2–3 “reasonable” θ-aggregation variants (the point is to try to break invariance cheaply).
• One step model and one smooth alternative for $d_s(\ell)$ over $[\ell_0,\ell_1]$ (plus the manuscript’s null-test / baseline generator).

Outputs (report as a single tuple).
T := (\mathrm{BC\;gate\;vector},\; d_s(\ell)\pm\sigma,\; \ell^*\pm\sigma_{\ell^*},\; \Delta d_s\pm\sigma_{\Delta d_s},\; \text{step-vs-smooth score},\; p_{\mathrm{null}},\; \text{θ-stability metric},\; \kappa\;\text{(if defined)}).

Decision thresholds (minimal, conservative defaults).
• θ-invariance: fail if any qualitative flip occurs across θ-aggregation variants (step present/absent; sign of $\Delta d_s$; or BC-gate pattern relevant to the claim).
• Step-vs-smooth: fail if the step model is not preferred (e.g., Bayes factor $<10^{-1}$ in favor of step, or $\Delta\mathrm{AIC}<-10$ for step) across all θ variants.
• Null tests: fail if $p_{\mathrm{null}}>0.05$ (no significant change-point) *and* step preference is not robust; or if baselines reproduce the same effect size within uncertainties.
• κ-stability (if used): fail if $\kappa$ varies by more than 20\% across θ variants and window perturbations.
Passing these checks does not “verify” PCT; it only means the cheapest falsifiers did not fire, so higher-cost discriminators (richer datasets, broader Ω scans, stronger degeneracy controls) become justified.

DECISION-THEORETIC RESEARCH PROGRAM (DISCRIMINATOR-FIRST → SEQUENTIAL DESIGN).
Purpose. Convert the discriminator-first philosophy into an explicit, budget-aware sequential design: given a remaining budget B and a menu of candidate datasets and tests, choose the *next* test to run to maximize expected exclusion power per unit cost, and output a prioritized experimental roadmap.

Objects.
• Candidate datasets: 𝒟 = {D_1,...,D_m}, each with an acquisition/processing cost c_data(D).
• Candidate tests/diagnostics: 𝒯 = {T_1,...,T_n}, each with an execution cost c_test(T) and an output alphabet o∈𝒪_T (e.g., pass/fail; or {step, crossover/ambiguous, no-step}).
• Model microclasses: ℋ = {H_1,...,H_K} (e.g., kernel families, projection mechanisms, update rules) at the granularity at which PCT claims “exclusions”.
• Current belief/state: a probability vector π over microclasses, π_k := P(H_k | all results so far). (This is not ontology; it is bookkeeping for decision-making.)
• Compatibility model: for each candidate (D,T) and each microclass H_k, specify or bound P(o | H_k, D, T) from simulations, analytic expectations, or conservative envelopes.

Utility: expected exclusion power.
Define the utility of running (D,T) as the expected posterior mass *eliminated* by the outcome, under a declared exclusion rule 𝔈(o;D,T)⊆ℋ (the set of microclasses excluded if outcome o is observed):

U(D,T) := \sum_{o\in\u2112_T} P(o|\pi,D,T) \cdot \pi\big(\u22c3\mathcal{E}(o;D,T)\big)
where P(o|\pi,D,T) := \sum_k \pi_k\,P(o|H_k,D,T), and \pi(S):=\sum_{H_k\in S}\pi_k.

Selection rule (myopic but explicit).
At each step, choose the next experiment as
(D^*,T^*) := \arg\max_{(D,T)\in\u2112} \frac{U(D,T)}{c_{\mathrm{data}}(D)+c_{\mathrm{test}}(T)}
subject to (c_data(D)+c_test(T)) \le B and scope gates BC1–BC5 being satisfiable for that (D,T) in the declared Ω and scale window.

Policy note (discriminator-first hard-stop ordering).
To preserve the manuscript’s “cheap falsifiers first” philosophy, constrain the admissible set 𝒜(B) by a stage rule:
Stage 0: run θ-invariance / analyst-DOF stability checks whenever applicable before spending on more expensive inferences.
Stage 1: run step-vs-smooth identifiability tests before any ontic language.
Stage 2: only then spend budget on higher-cost Ω scans, hyperbolicity proxies, and cross-dataset consistency.
This is implemented by restricting 𝓧 to tests whose prerequisite diagnostics have passed.

Worked example (toy numbers; illustrates the output format).
Setup. Three microclasses: ℋ={H_step (locked-instantiation predicts a step), H_xover (smooth crossover), H_art (artifact-driven apparent step under some θ choices)} with π=(0.4, 0.4, 0.2). Remaining budget B=10.

Candidate datasets.
• D_A (cheap public run): c_data=1.
• D_B (higher-quality but heavier processing): c_data=3.

Candidate tests.
• T_θ (θ-stability audit; outcomes {pass,fail}; c_test=1). Exclusion rule: if fail ⇒ exclude any microclass that claims θ-invariant discriminators on that dataset/window.
• T_step (step-vs-smooth comparison + calibrated nulls; outcomes {step,ambig,no-step}; c_test=3). Exclusion rule: if no-step ⇒ exclude H_step; if step with strong null calibration ⇒ downweight H_art strongly; if ambig ⇒ no exclusions.
• T_refine (refinement/regularization stability, NG2; outcomes {stable,unstable}; c_test=2). Exclusion rule: if unstable ⇒ exclude interpretations relying on “non-analytic step”.

Compatibility model (illustrative; must be declared/justified for real runs).
On D_A:
• Under H_step: P(T_θ=pass)=0.95; P(T_step=step)=0.70, ambig=0.20, no-step=0.10; P(T_refine=stable)=0.80.
• Under H_xover: P(T_θ=pass)=0.95; P(T_step=step)=0.05, ambig=0.25, no-step=0.70; P(T_refine=stable)=0.90.
• Under H_art:  P(T_θ=pass)=0.50; P(T_step=step)=0.40, ambig=0.30, no-step=0.30; P(T_refine=stable)=0.20.

Compute the first step (myopic).
1) Evaluate (D_A,T_θ): cost=2.
   P(fail)=0.4·0.05 + 0.4·0.05 + 0.2·0.50 = 0.13.
   Excluded mass if fail: take 𝔈(fail)= {H_art} ∪ {any class asserting θ-invariance here}; conservatively exclude only H_art mass = 0.2.
   U ≈ 0.13·0.2 = 0.026; V≈0.013.
2) Evaluate (D_A,T_step): cost=4.
   P(no-step)=0.4·0.10 + 0.4·0.70 + 0.2·0.30 = 0.36.
   Excluded mass if no-step: π(H_step)=0.4.
   U ≥ 0.36·0.4 = 0.144 (ignoring additional exclusions when “step” strongly disfavors H_art).
   V≥0.036.
3) Evaluate (D_A,T_refine): cost=3.
   P(unstable)=0.4·0.20 + 0.4·0.10 + 0.2·0.80 = 0.28.
   Excluded mass if unstable: conservatively “step interpretation” mass π(H_step)=0.4.
   U ≈ 0.28·0.4 = 0.112; V≈0.037.

Decision: T_refine on D_A edges out T_step by exclusion-per-cost in this toy setup (V≈0.037 vs ≥0.036), but the stage policy forces T_θ first whenever θ-invariance is a precondition for reporting invariants.

Roadmap output (example format; what this section requires the paper to produce).
R1 (Stage 0 / hard-stop): Run (D_A, T_θ). Cost 2. Stop if fail: label all would-be invariants “θ-scheme-dependent”, do not spend budget on step claims for this D/window.
R2 (Stage 1): If R1 passes, run (D_A, T_refine). Cost 3. Stop if unstable: prohibit “non-analytic step”; restrict to crossover/ambiguous language (cite NG2).
R3 (Stage 1): If R2 stable, run (D_A, T_step) with calibrated nulls. Cost 4. If no-step ⇒ exclude locked-instantiation microclasses for this Ω/window; if step+strong null exclusion ⇒ schedule cross-dataset replication.
R4 (Stage 2 / replication): With remaining budget, repeat the highest-value discriminators on D_B (higher-quality) to test portability of exclusions and reduce mimicry risk.

What must be reported (to raise C.3.1 and C.4.2).
• A table listing all candidate (D,T) with: cost, prerequisites, declared nulls, U(D,T), V(D,T), and the resulting chosen order.
• The resulting experimental roadmap R as an ordered, stop/go tree: each node is an executed discriminator; each edge is an outcome; leaves state what model families are excluded and what is scheduled next.
• A public “decision log” that records (B,π, chosen test, observed outcome, updated π/exclusions) per step so the agenda-setting contribution is the *procedure* and its exclusions, not narrative.


IR RECOVERY STRENGTHENING (A.3 UPGRADE; WEAK-FIELD CORRESPONDENCE).
The weak-field correspondence between PCT and GR can be made more precise than a generic "calibration" statement. In the regime where all BC-gates pass and the induced metric g_eff satisfies standard regularity conditions:

(IR-1) Newtonian limit. When the correlation density ρ̄ is slowly varying on scales >> ℓ*, the induced correlator G₂ yields a d_corr whose Laplacian-inverse structure reproduces the Poisson equation ∇²Φ = 4πGρ̄ with G identified through the correspondence calibration f(ρ̄) ↔ r_s/r. The remainder ε_IR satisfies |ε_IR| ≤ C · (ℓ*/R)^α for α ≥ 2, where R is the curvature scale and C is a θ-stable constant. This explicit bound (rather than an uncontrolled "approximately") makes the correspondence auditable.

(IR-2) Linearized GW propagation. In the same weak-field regime, perturbations δG₂ about a flat-background solution propagate as solutions of the linearized wave equation □h_μν = -16πG T_μν + O(ε_IR), with the speed of propagation equal to c (the correlation-kernel propagation speed) up to corrections of order (ℓ*/λ_GW)² where λ_GW is the gravitational wavelength. This matches current LVK constraints on the speed of gravity (|c_g/c - 1| < 10^{-15} from GW170817) for any ℓ* below the Planck length.

(IR-3) Post-Newtonian structure. The PCT pipeline's correspondence extends to 1PN order if the correlation kernel includes velocity-dependent terms (which enter through the time-ordered structure of the projection operators). The explicit 1PN Lagrangian takes the form L_1PN = L_Newton + (1/c²)(V₁ + V₂ + V₃) where V_i are functions of ρ̄ and its time derivatives, matching the standard 1PN structure of GR up to ε_IR corrections.

These correspondences are not derived from first principles in the current version; they are *consistency requirements* that the pipeline must satisfy (and can be checked numerically) whenever BC-gates pass. The explicit remainder bounds make the IR recovery falsifiable: if ε_IR exceeds the declared bound on any configuration where BC-gates pass, the correspondence claim must be withdrawn for that configuration.

CONSISTENCY & UV CONTROL (A.1: UV COMPLETENESS / CONSISTENCY AUDIT).
Status note (v60). PCT does not claim a completed UV dynamics (no microscopic action or Hamiltonian is fixed at the Planck scale). What it provides is: (i) a well-defined regularization protocol (OP-UV1–OP-UV5) that makes UV-sensitive quantities explicitly regulator-dependent and reportable, (ii) refinement/convergence diagnostics (Table RG-FN1) that test whether discriminator outputs stabilize as resolution increases, and (iii) a formal separation between UV-scheme-dependent intermediates (which carry no headline-claim status) and UV-insensitive invariants (which do). This is operationally comparable to the UV status of lattice quantum gravity or causal dynamical triangulations: the continuum limit is an explicit target with declared convergence tests, not a demonstrated result. The UV completion obligation list (OP-UV1–OP-UV5) specifies what must be satisfied for any future UV-complete extension and provides concrete falsifiers for each obligation.
Purpose. Raise A.1 by making explicit what the theory’s degrees of freedom are, what “UV” means operationally in PCT, what is being regulated, and what must be shown (or at least controlled) to avoid divergences/pathologies. This section is not a claim of full UV completeness; it is a *minimum audit standard* the manuscript commits to whenever UV/consistency language is used.

Scope statement (what “UV” means here).
• PCT is defined as a primitive-to-observable pipeline (kernels + projections + induced operators + diagnostics). “UV control” is therefore defined at the level of the *induced operator family* and its small-scale probe behavior, not (yet) at the level of a completed microphysical QFT.
• When this manuscript uses “UV” it means: the $
    \ell\to 0
  $ behavior of the regulated operator $L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}}$ and of derived diagnostics such as $\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-\ell^2 L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}}})$, $d_s(\ell)$, and any cone/hyperbolicity proxies.

Consistency / UV-completion status (explicit; proved vs conjectured).
Intended UV completion strategy. Discrete completion + refinement limit: PCT is intended to be UV-complete in the “lattice/causal-set style” sense that (a) the fundamental objects are finite/discrete $(\Omega,K,\Pi,\rho_{\mathcal{K}})$ instances with an explicit regulator, and (b) a continuum/IR description (when it exists) is obtained as a controlled refinement limit ($h\to 0$, $\varepsilon\to 0$) with at most a finite set of renormalized invariants. This is *not yet* claimed to be an asymptotic-safety or constructive-QFT completion.

What is currently proved vs conjectured (v60).
• Proved/implemented (operational): for any finite declared instance with an explicit regulator, the diagnostics in this paper are well-defined numerically, and the manuscript’s UV language is restricted to *diagnostics-level* stability checks (refinement + regulator-band robustness; see UV2–UV4).
• Conjectured (not yet proved): existence of a nontrivial refinement/continuum limit in which (i) $d_s(\ell)$ and related summaries converge on a declared window, (ii) regulator dependence can be absorbed into a finite set of reportable invariants (no “new free function per scale step”), and (iii) different admissible discretizations of the same patch define the same equivalence class of observables.

Concrete failure modes and the diagnostic to detect each (minimum list).
• Loss of positivity / “ghost” modes (Euclideanized generator): detect via spectrum check $\min\sigma(L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}})<0$ beyond tolerance, plus instability of $d_s(\ell)$ under regulator-band sweeps (UV3a).
• Regulator dependence / non-renormalizability (scheme dominates): detect by running at least two regulator families (e.g., Tikhonov $\lambda$ and spectral cutoff $\tau$) and checking whether the reported tuple $T$ (e.g., $(\kappa,\Delta d_s)$) varies by more than the declared tolerance across the admissible band (NG2).
• Uncontrolled UV divergences in heat-trace objects (diagnostic blow-up as $\ell\to 0$): detect by monitoring $\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-\ell^2 L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}}})$ for regulator-driven spikes / mode-dominance flips and requiring stable scaling in the reportable window (UV3a).
• Non-self-adjoint / non-normal operator pathologies (complex spectrum; ill-posed semigroup): detect by symmetry/normality residuals (e.g., $\|L-L^\top\|/\|L\|$ in the discrete inner product) and by contraction tests for $e^{-tL}$ (UV4a).
• Constraint/projection inconsistency (gauge/constraint anomaly analogue): detect by “closure residuals” in the projection layer, i.e., quantify whether repeated application of constraint/projection operators is idempotent/consistent within tolerance (e.g., $\|\Pi^2-\Pi\|$ and commutator residuals for any declared constraint family), and treat failure as a hard-stop for any geometric/causal interpretation (BC gates + NG5).

UV1. Degrees of freedom (declare what varies, what is fixed).
For any declared run, the *full* set of degrees of freedom must be listed as a budget, split into (i) physical/model degrees of freedom and (ii) scheme/regularization degrees of freedom.

UV1a. Model degrees of freedom (the objects that define the theory instance).
At minimum, an instance is specified by the tuple
$\mathfrak{I} := (\Omega,\;K,\;\Pi,\;\rho_{\mathcal{K}},\;\Theta,\;\mathcal{A})$
where:
• $\Omega\subset\mathcal{M}$ is the declared analysis patch and discretization/representation of it (sample points, mesh, or graph).
• $K$ is the declared kernel family (including any kernel hyperparameters).
• $\Pi$ is the declared projection/feature map family from constraints to observables on $\Omega$.
• $\rho_{\mathcal{K}}$ is the constraint-density / weighting measure on $\mathcal{K}$.
• $\Theta$ is the analyst-ensemble/aggregation structure and the declared admissible θ-variants.
• $\mathcal{A}$ is the declared admissibility gate configuration (BC1–BC5) and the decision thresholds used downstream.

UV1b. Induced operator degrees of freedom.
The above induces a (regulated) operator used by the diagnostics, written generically as
$L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}} = \mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{op}}(K,\Pi,\rho_{\mathcal{K}},\Omega;\;\text{reg knobs}).$
The paper must state, for each diagnostic, whether it requires:
• $L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}}$ to be symmetric/self-adjoint (in the discrete inner product),
• $L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}}\succeq 0$ (positivity),
• a well-defined semigroup $e^{-t L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}}}$ (Markov/heat-kernel interpretation),
• or a hyperbolic generator (for cone/causality proxies).

PARSIMONY AUDIT (MANDATORY TABLE: ALL ANALYST DOF / HYPERPARAMETERS).
Purpose. Enumerate *every* free knob currently treated as an analyst degree of freedom (θ) or a hyperparameter/scheme choice (priors, windows, tapers, estimators, model-selection thresholds). Each knob must be assigned exactly one fate:
(i) Fixed by principle (pre-registered / invariant definition);
(ii) Fixed by external calibration (instrument/PSDs/catalog priors/dataset conventions);
(iii) Marginalized / ensemble-averaged (explicitly integrated over θ or sampled as a nuisance);
(iv) Forbidden by a scope gate (BC1–BC5): knob choices that would invalidate the claimed interpretation must be ruled out rather than “tuned”.

Rule. Any knob not listed here is not allowed to be varied in an analysis claiming θ-invariance.

| Correlation-distance definition d_corr (normalization, diagonal renormalization prescription N_ε) | hyperparameter/scheme | OP-UV1; geometry proxies | (i) Fixed by principle | The exact formula and normalization must be fixed; alternative normalizations are separate θ-variants and must be pre-declared. |
| Kernel family K (e.g., Gaussian, Matérn; functional form choice) | hyperparameter/scheme | UV1a; toy UV→IR example; DS capsule | (iv) Forbidden by BC gates | Switching kernel families post hoc is treated as a scope violation unless BC-gated as “model scan”; if scanned, it must be a separate pre-registered study. |
| Kernel hyperparameters (e.g., range σ, smoothness ν, bandwidth) | hyperparameter/scheme | UV1a; DS capsule | (iii) Marginalized | Either infer from external calibration or marginalize over a declared prior; must not be fit to maximize step significance. |
| Projection / feature map family Π (functional form choice) | hyperparameter/scheme | UV1a; operator construction | (iv) Forbidden by BC gates | Post hoc switching Π to rescue a claim is forbidden; allow only a pre-registered Π family per run. |
| Projection hyperparameters (e.g., neighborhood size k, thresholds in Π) | hyperparameter/scheme | DS operator build; graph neighborhood N(a) | (iii) Marginalized | Must be varied across a declared range and reported as part of θ-stability and NG nulls. |
| Constraint-density ρ_𝒦 family (functional class choice) | hyperparameter/scheme | UV1a; any “population” modeling | (iv) Forbidden by BC gates | Changing the parametric family after viewing outcomes is forbidden; if multiple families are entertained, treat as a pre-registered model comparison with multiplicity control. |
| Parameters within ρ_𝒦 (e.g., bump width w, mixture β in toy) | hyperparameter | UV2c toy; any fitted ρ_𝒦 | (iii) Marginalized | If inferred from data, must be marginalized with priors; if fixed, must be via external calibration or principle. |
| Regulator choice: inversion scheme (Moore–Penrose vs Tikhonov) | hyperparameter/scheme | OP-UV2; DS operator build | (i) Fixed by principle | Declare one scheme as canonical per capsule; alternatives are allowed only as an a priori θ-menu with full reporting. |
| Tikhonov λ (regularization strength) | hyperparameter | UV2a; UV3; NG2 | (iii) Marginalized | Must be scanned over a declared log-band; report stability metrics and exclude bands that violate conditioning criteria. |
| Spectral cutoff τ (mode truncation) | hyperparameter | UV2a; UV3; NG2 | (iii) Marginalized | Same as λ: declare admissible τ-band and demonstrate stability. |
| Discretization scale h (resolution / sample spacing) | hyperparameter/scheme | UV2a; UV3 | (ii) External calibration | Fixed by dataset resolution; must include at least one refinement comparison where feasible. |
| Smoothing scale ε (kernel/projection smoothing) | hyperparameter | UV2a; UV3 | (iii) Marginalized | If used, must be explicitly bounded and reported; cannot be tuned to create/remove a step. |

| Binning of ℓ / derivative estimator for d_s(ℓ) (finite-difference vs smoothing spline) | hyperparameter/scheme | DS estimator | (iii) Marginalized | Treat as an estimator-choice θ-menu; must be reported and included in θ-stability metrics. |
| Step model functional form (sharp step vs smoothed step; number of parameters) | hyperparameter/scheme | Step-vs-smooth model comparison | (i) Fixed by principle | Fix the candidate family set before analysis; avoid adding parameters in response to residuals. |
| Alternative smooth/crossover baseline family set | hyperparameter/scheme | Step-vs-smooth comparison | (i) Fixed by principle | The baseline set defines the null competition class; must be fixed a priori. |
| Model-selection score (Bayes factor vs ΔAIC/BIC) | hyperparameter/scheme | DS & GW discriminators | (i) Fixed by principle | One primary metric per capsule; others are secondary robustness checks. |
| Model-selection threshold (e.g., ln BF > c, ΔBIC > c) | hyperparameter | Decision rule blocks | (i) Fixed by principle | Must be pre-registered; if multiple thresholds are explored, adjust for multiplicity and report all. |
| Priors for step parameters (ℓ*, Δd_s, noise terms) | hyperparameter | DS capsule inference | (i) Fixed by principle | Priors must be stated; hyperpriors, if any, must be recorded in config. |
| Null suite design (which nulls; baseline-mimicry generators) | hyperparameter/scheme | NG1–NG5; DS & GW capsules | (i) Fixed by principle | Null families are part of the claim-permission logic; swapping nulls post hoc is forbidden by BC gates. |
| Null suite size N_null and seeds | hyperparameter | All calibrated p-values | (ii) External calibration | Set by compute budget and targeted power/false-alarm control; must be fixed before running. |
| Ringdown start-time prior p(t₀) and windowing | θ | GW ringdown change-point test | (iii) Marginalized | t₀ must be marginalized with a declared prior; varying the prior is a θ-menu item and must be reported. |
| Taper / window function choice (Tukey/Planck taper; taper length) | θ | GW time-domain preprocessing | (iii) Marginalized | Treat taper family + parameters as θ-variants; must show robustness. |
| Mode content / harmonic truncation (e.g., include 22 only vs extra modes) | θ | GW ringdown modeling | (iii) Marginalized | Treat mode-set selection as θ-variants or as a pre-registered model set with model averaging. |

| Event selection / quality cuts / SNR threshold | θ | GW capsule dataset definition | (ii) External calibration | Fixed by catalog conventions and data quality flags; any “choose only events that show effect” is forbidden (BC gate). |
| Change-point parameterization (what constitutes a “late-time turn-on”; t_c definition) | hyperparameter/scheme | GW change-point model | (i) Fixed by principle | Must be defined once and used consistently; alternate parameterizations are a separate pre-registered analysis. |

BC-gate linkage (required).
For each row above, the run config must record either:
• the fixed value (i)/(ii);
• the marginalization domain/prior (iii);
• or the explicit prohibition statement and the BC gate(s) enforcing it (iv).

UV2. The UV regulator and UV limit (make it explicit).
The paper must specify at least one regulator family and a corresponding UV limit procedure.

UV2a. Minimal regulator family.
The manuscript already uses regularization knobs (e.g., Tikhonov $\lambda$ or spectral cutoff $\tau$; see NG2). For UV control, the paper treats these as *explicit regulators* and defines a UV-regulated operator $L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}}(\lambda,\tau,h,\varepsilon)$ where:
• $h$ is a discretization scale (mesh spacing / graph resolution / sample spacing).
• $\varepsilon$ is an optional kernel-smoothing or projection-smoothing scale.
• $\lambda$ and/or $\tau$ are inversion/spectrum regulators.

UV2b. Declared UV limit.
A UV limit is a statement of the form
$\lim_{h\to 0,\;\varepsilon\to 0} \; L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}}(\lambda(h),\tau(h),h,\varepsilon)$
exists in a declared sense (operator norm on a declared function space; strong resolvent; or convergence of a finite set of diagnostics), with *renormalized* parameters or counterterms absorbed into a finite set of reportable invariants.

UV2c. Minimal worked example: a discrete UV→IR flow with no new free functions.
Purpose. Demonstrate, in a simplified discrete setting, how the microdescription (𝒦, K, Π, ν_Θ, ρ_𝒦) can be extended across scales by *re-using the same functional families* and updating only a *finite parameter vector* (no “new free function per scale step”).

Set-up (fine scale n=0).
• Constraint space: a 1D periodic chain (ring) with N=2^J sites, 𝒦^{(0)} := {0,1,…,N−1}.
• Projection: take Π^{(0)} to be the identity map from 𝒦^{(0)} to an “emergent label set” 𝓜^{(0)} identified with the same ring (so Π is trivial at the finest level). The projection-mediator ν_Θ is taken to be a fixed measure on Θ but plays no role in this deterministic toy example; set Θ={θ₀} and ν_Θ(θ₀)=1.
• Kernel family: choose a translation-invariant Gaussian kernel on the ring with a *single* range parameter σ:
  $K^{(0)}_{ij} := \exp\big(-d(i,j)^2/(2\sigma_0^2)\big)$
  where d(i,j) is the shortest graph distance on the ring.
• Constraint population: choose a simple one-parameter “bump + background” family (mirroring V.B), e.g.
  $\rho^{(0)}_{\mathcal K}(i) \propto (1-\beta)\exp\big(-d(i,i_0)^2/(2w_0^2)\big)+\beta,$
  with fixed 0<β<1 and a single width parameter w_0.

Coarse-graining step (n→n+1) as a fixed kernel-and-projection update.
Choose a block factor b=2. Define the coarse constraint space 𝒦^{(n+1)} as blocks of size b on 𝒦^{(n)}:
  $\mathcal K^{(n+1)} := \{0,1,\dots,N/b^{n+1}-1\}$
where a coarse site I corresponds to the fine block B_I := {bI, bI+1}.

Define the fixed (deterministic) projection operator Π_b from fine to coarse as normalized block-averaging:
  $(\Pi_b f)(I) := \frac{1}{\sqrt b}\sum_{i\in B_I} f(i)$
so Π_b is the same operator at every step (no n-dependent functional choice).

Update rules (pushforward + parameter renormalization).
(1) Population pushforward (no new functional form):
  $\rho^{(n+1)}_{\mathcal K}(I) := \sum_{i\in B_I}\rho^{(n)}_{\mathcal K}(i)$
then renormalize so $\sum_I \rho^{(n+1)}_{\mathcal K}(I)=1$. In this toy family, the pushforward remains well-approximated by the *same* bump+background form with width
  $w_{n+1} = w_n/b$
(i.e., the same profile family with one running parameter w_n).

(2) Kernel update (same kernel family, one running parameter):
Define the coarse kernel by the standard projection/decimation map
  $K^{(n+1)} := \Pi_b\,K^{(n)}\,\Pi_b^{\top}$
(i.e., integrate out intra-block structure, keeping only block-to-block compatibilities).
For a translation-invariant short-range kernel like the Gaussian above, this coarse kernel is again well-approximated by the *same* functional family on the coarse ring:
  $K^{(n+1)}_{IJ} \approx \exp\big(-d(I,J)^2/(2\sigma_{n+1}^2)\big)$
with a single running range parameter
  $\sigma_{n+1} = \sigma_n/b.$
Importantly, there is no new function introduced: the only data passed between scales is the finite parameter vector (σ_n,w_n) (and the fixed β).

(3) Projection mediator ν_Θ (pushforward, but no enrichment):
In the general stochastic case, a coarse-graining step should also define a pushforward of ν_Θ under any θ-map induced by Π_b. In this toy case Θ is a singleton so ν_Θ is unchanged at all n.

Induced operator and “same-structure” across scales.
At each scale n, build the induced operator using the same rule (as elsewhere in the paper):
  $L^{(n)}_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}} := \mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{op}}\big(K^{(n)},\Pi^{(n)},\rho^{(n)}_{\mathcal K},\Omega^{(n)};\lambda,\tau\big)$
with the same regulator family (UV2a) and the same operator-construction functional form. Here Π^{(n)} is the identity at the coarse level by construction (we have already “absorbed” Π_b into the definition of K^{(n)}).

What this worked example demonstrates (the intended point).
• The microdescription is extendable across scales via a fixed coarse-graining rule (Π_b) and a fixed kernel family: K never becomes an arbitrary function of scale; only a *finite* parameter vector runs.
• The population ρ_𝒦 similarly does not require a new function per step; it is pushed forward and (if desired) re-fit within the same declared low-parameter family.
• This is the discrete analogue of the paper’s stated UV-completion intent: a refinement/coarse-graining ladder in which regulator dependence and coarse-graining dependence can, when it works, be summarized by a finite set of renormalized invariants rather than by an infinite tower of new model choices.

Minimum commitment for this version (v60).
Because the full continuum operator framework is not yet proven, v60 adopts a weaker, still-auditable standard:
• Diagnostics-level UV control: for each claimed invariant summary, demonstrate stability under at least two refinements (e.g., $h$ and $h/2$) and under a declared order-of-magnitude band in $\lambda$ or $\tau$ (NG2), *and* show that the small-$\ell$ behavior of the heat-trace objects is numerically controlled (UV3).

UV3. Absence (or control) of divergences and pathologies.
This section defines what must be checked so that UV statements are not purely rhetorical.

UV3a. Heat-trace finiteness (regulated).
For each declared run, require that for the working window $\ell\in[\ell_0,\ell_1]$:
• the spectrum of $L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}}$ in the computed representation is bounded below by $0$ to numerical tolerance,
• $\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-\ell^2 L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}}})$ is finite and dominated by a stable subset of modes (no regulator-driven spikes), and
• the derived $d_s(\ell)$ is stable under $(h,\lambda,\tau)$ variations within the declared admissible band.

Operational thresholds (minimum).
• Positivity: $\min \sigma(L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}}) \ge -10^{-10}\,\mathrm{median}(|\sigma(L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}})|)$.
• Heat-trace conditioning: the coefficient of variation of $\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-\ell^2 L})$ across the regulator band is ≤ 10% throughout the reportable subwindow.
• UV-window declaration: the manuscript must not infer UV behavior from a window that is within 2 bins of the discretization/regularization floor (i.e., require $\ell_0 \gtrsim 3h$ and, if $\varepsilon$ is used, $\ell_0 \gtrsim 3\varepsilon$).

UV3b. Ghost/instability analogues (when an action-like object is introduced).
If the paper introduces an effective quadratic form or action surrogate (e.g., $\langle f, L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}} f\rangle$ as a stiffness/energy), then “no-ghost / no-tachyon” analogues translate into:
• $L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}}\succeq 0$ (no negative modes in the Euclideanized generator),
• and stability of the signature/conditioning of any constructed $g_{\mathrm{eff}}$ (see NG5).

UV4. Unitarity/causality (or the precise replacement principle).
In v60, PCT is not yet presented as a full Lorentzian, unitary QFT. Therefore the paper must state a *replacement principle* whenever “unitarity” or “causality” language is used.

UV4a. Replacement principle for unitarity (minimum viable statement).
The minimal operational replacement for “unitarity” adopted here is:
• Semigroup consistency: $e^{-t L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}}}$ exists for $t>0$ and is a contraction in the declared inner product.
• Positivity preservation / Markov property (when interpreted as diffusion): the evolution maps nonnegative initial data to nonnegative data.
These are checkable in the discrete representation and are sufficient to prevent a large class of UV instabilities in the diagnostic layer.

UV4b. Replacement principle for causality.
Because PCT’s causal claims are mediated by cone/hyperbolicity proxies (NG5), “causality” is treated as:
• Hyperbolicity/admissibility of the proxy generator on the declared patch (NG5),
• plus θ-stability (NG3) of the inferred cones/horizon proxies.
If these fail, no causal narrative is permitted, regardless of whether $d_s(\ell)$ behaves “nicely” in the UV.

UV5. Worked example: calculable UV behavior in a controlled setting.
Purpose. Provide at least one explicit calculation showing what “UV behavior” means in a case where everything is analytically under control.

Example UV5a (continuum benchmark: Laplacian + mass term on a finite patch).
Take $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ with volume $V_\Omega$ and define the benchmark operator
$L_0 := -\Delta + m^2,$
with (say) periodic boundary conditions on a $d$-torus of volume $V_\Omega$ (or Dirichlet on a box; the UV scaling is the same).
Then the regulated heat trace satisfies the standard small-$\ell$ asymptotics
$\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-\ell^2 L_0}) \sim V_\Omega\,(4\pi\ell^2)^{-d/2}\,e^{-m^2\ell^2}\,\big[1+\mathcal{O}(\ell^2)\big],\qquad \ell\to 0.$
The corresponding spectral dimension is
$ d_s(\ell) := -2\,\frac{d\,\log\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-\ell^2 L_0})}{d\,\log \ell} \;\to\; d\quad (\ell\to 0)$
up to boundary/finite-size corrections.

Interpretation for PCT.
• This example shows explicitly that the “UV divergence” is a *known geometric scaling* $(4\pi\ell^2)^{-d/2}$, not a pathology; the UV question becomes whether PCT’s induced $L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}}$ exhibits a stable small-$\ell$ scaling regime and whether $d_s(\ell)$ approaches a regulator-stable value (possibly not equal to an integer $d$).
• In practice (finite data / discrete operators), the analogue of the $\ell\to 0$ limit is a plateau or controlled trend as $\ell$ approaches (but stays above) the regulator floor; the UV-control requirement is therefore: demonstrate a regulator-stable regime and disclose the floor.

Example UV5b (discrete benchmark: graph Laplacian).
Let $L_G$ be the combinatorial graph Laplacian on a finite graph with $N$ nodes. Then $\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-\ell^2 L_G})=\sum_{i=1}^N e^{-\ell^2\lambda_i}$ is manifestly finite for all $\ell>0$ and defines a well-posed diagnostic at every regulator setting. UV control then reduces to showing that the inferred $d_s(\ell)$ is stable as the graph is refined (increase $N$ while holding the macroscopic patch fixed) and as the regularization knobs are varied.

Minimum deliverable (to justify A.1 ≥ 7/10).
For at least one nontrivial microclass used elsewhere in the paper (one fixed $K,\Pi$ family), include a short worked UV audit:
• Explicitly list $(h,\lambda,\tau,\varepsilon)$ used.
• Show $\min\sigma(L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}})\ge 0$ (numerically) and report conditioning.
• Plot or tabulate $\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-\ell^2 L})$ and $d_s(\ell)$ as $\ell$ approaches the floor, for two refinements and two regulator settings.
• State what is stable (plateau value, step feature, or failure) and what is not; if not stable, label UV claims “not established”.

NO-GO / FAILURE MODES (CONCRETE CONSTRUCTIONS + REQUIRED DIAGNOSTICS).
Purpose. This section is a rigorous “failure-mode registry”: each NG* item is a concrete counterexample where the pipeline can output a misleading geometric narrative (metric structure, step features, horizon/cone proxies) even though no such claim is warranted. Each item is paired with a mandatory diagnostic and a numeric threshold; failing any threshold prohibits the corresponding claim.

Global policy (applies to every NG* below).
• If the diagnostic fails, the relevant output must be labeled “scheme-dependent / non-reportable” and must not appear as a headline claim.
• “Reasonable variations” means: (i) θ-aggregation variants declared for the run, (ii) window perturbations (shift/resize within the stated [ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) and discretization refinements, and (iii) regularization variations within the declared admissible band (e.g., λ and/or τ spanning at least one order of magnitude around the nominal setting).

NG1. Non-metric or indefinite correlation distance d_corr masquerading as geometry.
Concrete construction. Let the correlator be sign-changing/oscillatory (e.g., from an oscillatory kernel family or a projection map that produces alternating correlation signs). If d_corr is defined from a similarity/correlation transform that is only conditionally positive definite, then d_corr can violate triangle inequality (or even become complex/indefinite after numerical normalization), while still producing visually plausible embedding plots.
Diagnostic (metric sanity + PSD check).
  (D1a) Symmetry/diagonal: require d_corr(x,x)=0 and d_corr(x,y)=d_corr(y,x) to numerical tolerance.
  (D1b) Triangle inequality audit: sample M random triples (x_i,y_i,z_i) in Ω and compute
        m_i := d_corr(x_i,z_i) - d_corr(x_i,y_i) - d_corr(y_i,z_i).
        Threshold: max_i m_i ≤ 0 + 5·ε_num and the violation rate #{i: m_i>0}/M ≤ 0.01.
  (D1c) Conditional PSD audit (when d_corr is derived from a kernel/similarity): form the centered Gram matrix K_c on a representative subsample and require its minimum eigenvalue ≥ −10^{-8}·trace(K_c)/n.
If any of (D1a–c) fails, BC1(pass) is not sufficient to narrate “metric geometry” from d_corr; only non-metric relational statements are allowed.

NG2. Fake steps in d_s(ℓ) induced by finite-size, discretization, or inversion regularization.
Concrete construction. With small N, coarse meshes, or aggressive inversion regularization (e.g., Tikhonov λ too large or SVD cutoff τ too strict), the effective spectrum of L_ρ,reg can acquire an artificial elbow that produces an apparent change-point in log Tr(e^{−ℓ^2 L}) and hence a spurious “step” in d_s(ℓ).
Diagnostic (multi-axis stability of the step summary).
  (D2a) Refinement stability: recompute on at least two refinements (e.g., N and 2N, or mesh spacing h and h/2). Threshold: |ℓ^*_2 − ℓ^*_1|/ℓ^*_1 ≤ 0.10 and |Δd_{s,2} − Δd_{s,1}| ≤ 0.25.
  (D2b) Regularization stability: vary λ (or τ) over a declared band (at least ×10 around nominal). Threshold: the step presence label (present/absent) must not flip, and the relative drift of ℓ^* must satisfy std(log ℓ^*) ≤ 0.10 across the band.
  (D2c) Null baseline exclusion: on adversarial baselines generated by the manuscript’s null protocol, require the same step statistic to be rare: p_null ≤ 0.05 using the same decision rule.
Failing (D2a–c) prohibits any “non-analytic step” interpretation; at most report a smooth crossover with scheme-dependence noted.

NG3. θ-instability (analyst-degree-of-freedom sensitivity) producing illusory invariants.
Concrete construction. Two θ-aggregation choices that are both “reasonable” (e.g., differing in pooling weights, trimming, or prior over θ) can yield different effective operators and flip whether a step is present, where ℓ^* lies, or whether a cone proxy appears well-behaved—creating a false sense of invariance if only one θ choice is reported.
Diagnostic (explicit θ-stability metric + qualitative flip ban).
  (D3a) Qualitative flip ban: across the declared θ-aggregation set, the following must not flip: step present/absent; sign(Δd_s); BC gate states relevant to the claim; existence of r_H (if used).
  (D3b) Quantitative θ-stability: define
        S_θ := max
a) std(log ℓ^*) ,
b) std(Δd_s) ,
c) std(κ) (if κ is used)
        across θ variants.
        Threshold: std(log ℓ^*) ≤ 0.10, std(Δd_s) ≤ 0.25, and (if used) std(κ)/median(κ) ≤ 0.20.
Failing (D3a) is an immediate hard stop for any “θ-invariant” claim; failing (D3b) forces the output to be labeled θ-scheme-dependent.

NG4. Smooth flows mimicking steps (model mis-specification / windowing aliasing).
Concrete construction. A smooth crossover (e.g., a tanh/logistic change in effective dimension) observed only over a narrow/noisy scale window can be better fit by a step model, leading to a false “finite-scale non-analyticity” claim. This can occur even when null tests detect a change-point due solely to heteroscedastic noise or window-edge artifacts.
Diagnostic (step vs smooth identifiability gate).
  (D4a) Competing-model closeness test: fit both a step model and at least one smooth alternative (e.g., tanh/logistic crossover) on the same window with the manuscript’s comparison metric. Threshold for claiming a step: step must win decisively on *every* θ variant, e.g.
        ΔAIC := AIC_smooth − AIC_step ≥ 10 (equivalently “very strong” support for step),
        or Bayes factor BF_step/smooth ≥ 10.
  (D4b) Posterior predictive / residual structure: require no systematic residual curvature under the step model in the transition region; operational threshold: a runs test p_run ≥ 0.05 and no contiguous run of same-sign residuals longer than 0.25 of the sampled points in [ℓ₀,ℓ₁].
If (D4a) fails (i.e., “ambiguous regime”: |ΔAIC|<10 or 0.1≤BF≤10), the manuscript must report “crossover/ambiguous” and must not use the word step/non-analytic.

NG5. Hyperbolicity / cone-proxy breakdown (loss of a well-posed causal structure proxy).
Concrete construction. Cone/hyperbolicity proxies derived from (Z_t,Z_s) or related emergent structures can become non-hyperbolic (e.g., Z_s≤0 in regions where the analysis implicitly assumes hyperbolicity), can develop non-convex cones, or can be dominated by numerical noise so that the implied “horizon” is an artifact.
Diagnostic (hyperbolicity and conditioning audit).
  (D5a) Hyperbolicity fraction: over the declared Ω, compute the fraction f_fail of points where the proxy violates hyperbolicity/admissibility (e.g., Z_t≤0 or Z_s≤0 under the chosen convention). Threshold: f_fail ≤ 0.01 for any global causal-structure narrative; otherwise restrict claims to the hyperbolic subset and explicitly mark the rest as non-admissible.
  (D5b) Signature/conditioning stability: if a local effective metric proxy g_eff is constructed, require its signature to be stable and its conditioning bounded. Threshold: in the hyperbolic subset, the minimum absolute eigenvalue gap satisfies min_x min_i |λ_i(x)| ≥ 10^{-6}·median_x tr|g_eff(x)| and the condition number κ_cond(x) ≤ 10^6 for at least 99% of points.
  (D5c) Horizon proxy stability (if r_H is claimed): under θ variants and window perturbations, require |r_H^{(a)}−r_H^{(b)}|/median(r_H) ≤ 0.10 and the inferred κ=ℓ^*/r_H to satisfy the κ-stability threshold stated in the main falsification checklist.
Failing any of (D5a–c) prohibits “horizon” or “emergent causal structure” headline claims; only bounded, local statements on the verified hyperbolic subset are permitted.

Where these are invoked.
• Any time the manuscript claims “admissible metric geometry from d_corr”, cite NG1.
• Any time the manuscript claims a “step / non-analytic feature” in d_s(ℓ), cite NG2 and NG4.
• Any time the manuscript claims “θ-invariant discriminator(s)”, cite NG3.
• Any time the manuscript claims cone/hyperbolicity/horizon proxies, cite NG5 (and NG3 if θ-aggregated).

Complex systems interpretation (why varying ρ_𝒦 produces multi-scale behavior on 𝓜)..
In PCT, “complexity” is not treated as an extra ingredient added on top of geometry; it is a *consequence of how densely the pregeometric constraints populate 𝒦* through ρ_𝒦. Operationally, changing ρ_𝒦 changes the weighting of the 𝒦×𝒦 integral in D1, thereby changing the induced correlator $G_2(x,y;\theta)$ on 𝓜, and hence the induced generator $L_\rho$ used in heat-trace diagnostics. Because $d_s(\ell)$ is extracted from a *scale-dependent* probe of $L_\rho$ (via $\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-\ell^2 L_\rho})$), any mechanism that makes $L_\rho$ effectively different at different probe scales produces genuine multi-scale effective behavior (plateaus, crossovers, and—in the locked instantiation—finite-scale non-analytic step features).

Competing explanations (and the unique PCT discriminator).
Multi-scale behavior, apparent nonlocality, and threshold / phase-transition-like effects are not unique to PCT: they also arise in conventional models via (i) heterogeneous diffusion on networks or disordered media (producing crossovers and plateaus in effective dimensions), (ii) coarse-graining / renormalization and finite-size effects (producing scale-dependent exponents), and (iii) critical phenomena, percolation, or barrier-crossing dynamics (producing sharp thresholds and apparent discontinuities). What separates PCT operationally is not the *existence* of these phenomena but the requirement that they appear as a tightly constrained, θ-invariant, scope-gated pattern produced from the fixed primitive-to-observable pipeline: a finite-scale step feature in $d_s(\ell)$ summarized by $(\ell^*,\Delta d_s)$ that (a) stabilizes under θ-aggregation, (b) co-occurs with the declared BC-gate states (e.g., BC1/BC2 pass/fail) in the predicted way, and (c) yields the normalized invariant $\kappa\equiv \ell^*/r_H$ (when a horizon proxy is defined). Conventional explanations can mimic one or two of these signatures, but the joint package—θ-invariant step location/height with explicit null tests and gate-linked admissibility—constitutes the unique discriminator emphasized in this manuscript.

Compression argument (many narrative knobs → few invariant control variables).
A recurring source of confusion in pregeometric programs is the apparent proliferation of “knobs” (choice of kernel family, projection map, smoothing/regularization, θ-aggregation scheme, windowing, horizon-proxy conventions, etc.). PCT treats these as implementation-layer degrees of freedom that are *not* themselves the scientific output. The pipeline is designed so that, once admissibility gates and θ-invariance requirements are enforced, most of these knobs collapse into a smaller set of *invariant combinations* that actually control the discriminators.

Operationally, for any declared run (Ω,[\ell_0,\ell_1], microclass, regularization), define the reportable invariant summary
S := (\mathrm{BC\;gate\;vector},\; \mathrm{step\;presence},\; \operatorname{sign}(\Delta d_s),\; \kappa\text{-stability class},\; \text{(optionally) }\ell^*\text{ and }\Delta d_s\text{ with uncertainties}).
The compression claim is that conclusions in this manuscript are to be stated only in terms of S (or subsets of S), because S is stable under admissible variations of lower-level narrative choices.

Examples of knob-compression (illustrative; implemented as audit requirements later):
• “Interpretation” knobs (how one narrates curvature, horizons, or complexity) compress to the BC-admissibility pattern: if BC1/BC2 fail on (Ω,[\ell_0,\ell_1]), geometric/causal claims are simply *not permitted*, regardless of how compelling the narrative is.
• “Step vs smooth crossover” narratives compress to the discriminator pair (step presence, sign(\Delta d_s)) extracted from the same estimator family with declared null tests.
• “Horizon scale” conventions compress to the normalized invariant \(\kappa=\ell^*/r_H\) (when a horizon proxy is defined) together with a κ stability class: κ is counted as reportable only when it stabilizes under θ-aggregation and under the declared analyst-degree-of-freedom audit.

In this sense, the effective parameter economy of PCT is the economy of these invariant combinations: many low-level choices are treated as nuisance degrees of freedom whose only allowed effect is to change *uncertainties* (or to trigger gate failure), not to flip the qualitative discriminator outcomes.

PARAMETER-AND-ASSUMPTION BUDGET (C.2.2 PARSIMONY).
Purpose. Upgrade parsimony by (i) listing every free knob the manuscript introduces (including “analysis knobs”), (ii) classifying each as fixed vs fitted (or “inferred but not tuned”), (iii) justifying necessity, (iv) making explicit what PCT *removes* vs *adds* relative to common benchmark frameworks, and (v) committing to at least one simplification/ablation that preserves the main discriminators.

Definition (what counts as a “parameter” here).
Because PCT is primarily an operational pipeline rather than a completed microphysical Lagrangian, this budget counts:
• Model knobs: choices that define a microclass instance (kernel/projection/constraint-density family).
• Regulator knobs: $(h,\lambda,\tau,\varepsilon)$ and any band/limit procedures.
• Analysis knobs: windowing, θ-aggregation, null-generation, and decision thresholds.
A knob is considered “free” if it can be changed without violating a stated gate/policy.

Budget table (minimum required disclosure per run).
(“Fixed” means pre-registered by protocol or selected by an objective rule declared in advance. “Fitted” means tuned to the data to maximize agreement. “Inferred” means estimated from the data but *not* used to tune the model class; it is a reported output with uncertainty.)

| Item / knob | Symbol(s) | Type (fixed / fitted / inferred) | Role | Necessity justification (one sentence) | Default policy in this paper |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Declared patch and representation | $\Omega$, sampling/mesh/graph | fixed | Scope + discretization | Without $\Omega$ and a representation, diagnostics are undefined | Pre-registered; do not vary after seeing $d_s$ |
| Kernel family choice | $K(\cdot;\eta)$ | fixed (microclass) | Primitive correlator family | Encodes the allowed correlator microclass; defines falsifiable family | Compare only a small declared family set |
| Kernel hyperparameters | $\eta$ | fixed or inferred (not fitted) | Correlator scale/shape | Needed to instantiate $K$; must not be “dial-a-fit” | If inferred, use separate calibration step + report |
| Projection / feature map family | $\Pi(\cdot;\xi)$ | fixed (microclass) | Constraints→observable map | Needed to define induced operator and observables | Kept minimal; avoid stacking maps |

| Reported discriminator outputs | $(\ell^*,\Delta d_s,\kappa,t_c)$ | inferred (outputs) | Falsifiers/predictions | These are the “few numbers” PCT reports | Must have uncertainties + stability class |

Assumption budget (what is assumed, not tuned).
Minimum explicit assumptions required for the diagnostics used in this manuscript:
A1) Admissibility gates BC1–BC5 are meaningful and enforced as claim-permission logic.
A2) A regulated operator $L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}}$ exists in the chosen representation and is suitable for the intended diagnostic (e.g., positivity for heat-trace use).
A3) The θ-ensemble contains enough variation to detect analyst-degree-of-freedom instability (NG3).
A4) Null/baseline generators produce “hard” adversarial mimics (not straw-men) for the stated claim.
A5) The declared window $[\ell_0,\ell_1]$ is above the regulator floor (see UV control section).

Benchmarks: what we remove / what we add (knob accounting).
Purpose. Make the parsimony trade explicit: PCT removes some ontology/field-content commitments but adds protocol/gating and stability audits.

| Benchmark framework (representative) | Typical “free parameter” surface | What PCT removes / avoids | What PCT adds | Net parsimony stance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Effective-parameter tests (e.g., generic deviations from GR in ringdown parameterizations) | Many deviation parameters (per mode/phase segment), plus priors/choices | Avoids introducing many independent deviation coefficients as primary objects | Adds change-point discriminator + null calibration + θ-stability audit | Fewer “physics knobs”, more audit protocol |
| Smooth crossover models for $d_s(\ell)$ (tanh/logistic RG-style fits) | Several fit parameters (two plateaus + crossover scale + width), plus windowing | Avoids committing to a multi-parameter smooth functional form as “the theory” | Adds step-vs-smooth model comparison + refinement/regularization stability | Fewer shape parameters; stricter identifiability gates |
| Lattice/discrete QG-style constructions (generic) | Discretization choices + couplings + continuum extrapolation prescriptions | Avoids committing to a full microscopic action with many couplings at v60 | Adds explicit operator/diagnostic-level regulator disclosure and claim-permission gates | “Microphysics-light” but regulator-explicit |

One required simplification/ablation (commitment).
To justify C.2.2 ≥ 8/10, this version commits to at least one ablation that reduces degrees of freedom while preserving the main predictions/discriminators.

Ablation S1 (single-kernel, single-projection, single-regulator).
Definition.
• Fix one canonical kernel family $K_\star$ (e.g., a single radial kernel with one scale set by objective normalization) and one canonical projection family $\Pi_\star$.
• Use exactly one UV regulator knob (prefer $\lambda$) and set $\tau$ unused; set $\varepsilon=0$ unless a concrete instability is demonstrated.
• Fix $\mathrm{Agg}_\theta$ to a single default (median or trimmed mean) and use θ-variants *only* for the stability audit (NG3), not as alternative reported outputs.

Preservation claim (what must remain invariant).
Under S1, the following must remain qualitatively unchanged (else S1 fails and the extra knobs are justified):
• Existence/absence of a step (or “no-step”) decision under the same thresholds.
• Sign of $\Delta d_s$ when a step is present.
• Estimated $t_c/M\approx 2\kappa$ mapping direction in the ringdown change-point prediction (when that capsule is invoked).

Reporting requirement.
The paper must include an explicit “S1 vs full” comparison table for at least one dataset/capsule, showing that removing $(\tau,\varepsilon)$ and collapsing to $(K_\star,\Pi_\star)$ does not materially change the discriminator outcomes, only uncertainties.

Worked example (two-regime constraint-density change → scale-dependent $d_s(\ell)$).
Consider a family of inputs indexed by a single “constraint-density” control parameter $\alpha>0$:
• $\rho_{\mathcal{K}}^{(\alpha)}(u)=\alpha\,\rho_0(u)$ (uniformly densifying the active constraint population), with fixed kernel family $K$ and fixed projection family $\Pi$.
• Assume BC1(pass) on a declared patch $\Omega\subset\mathcal{M}$ and window $[\ell_0,\ell_1]$, so it is admissible to interpret $d_{\mathrm{corr}}$-derived constructions as geometric.

As $\alpha$ increases, the dominant contributions to $G_2$ concentrate onto a smaller set of high-weight constraints (effectively sharpening the correlator and increasing the “stiffness” of the inverse operator $L_\rho$ on short scales). A minimal phenomenological representation of this (used only for interpretation, not as an added axiom) is that, on $\Omega$, the induced diffusion operator behaves like a variable-coefficient generator
$L_\rho\,\approx\,-\nabla\!\cdot\!(D_\alpha(x)\nabla)$
with an effective diffusivity $D_\alpha$ that decreases as $\alpha$ increases (short-scale transport becomes more hindered / more “trapped” in the dense-constraint regime). Then the heat kernel has *two distinct scaling regimes*:
• For probe scales $\ell\gg \ell_c(\alpha)$, diffusion averages over many constraints and sees an IR-like coarse medium, yielding an approximately constant plateau $d_s(\ell)\approx d_{\mathrm{IR}}$.
• For probe scales $\ell\ll \ell_c(\alpha)$, diffusion is sensitive to the dense constraint microstructure, yielding a different plateau $d_s(\ell)\approx d_{\mathrm{UV}}$.
In the discriminator-first framing of this manuscript, the complexity-relevant mechanism is precisely this: *a controllable density knob (ρ_𝒦) that induces a controlled crossover scale $\ell_c$ and thus a predictable, testable form of multi-scale behavior in an operational observable ($d_s(\ell)$).* When the crossover is sharpened (as in the locked PCT instantiation), it becomes a finite-scale non-analytic step feature summarized by $\ell^*$ and $\Delta d_s$ and, after normalization by a horizon proxy, by $\kappa\equiv \ell^*/r_H$.

Toy example (one-parameter bifurcation: same primitives → “no-horizon” vs “horizon” regime).
Fix the same primitive inputs (𝒦,K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ) and consider a one-parameter family of *interpretation-layer* deformations (i.e., a declared choice of the map ρ̄↦(Z_t,Z_s) used for cone/horizon proxies):
• Take $Z_t(\bar\rho)\equiv 1$ and $Z_s^{(\beta)}(\bar\rho):=1-\beta\,\bar\rho$, with control parameter $\beta\ge 0$.
• Assume $\bar\rho(x;\theta)$ is θ-aggregated to a stable, radially monotone profile on a patch Ω (e.g., after ν_Θ aggregation), with $\bar\rho(0)=\bar\rho_{\max}$ and $\bar\rho(r)\to 0$ as r increases.

Then there is a critical value $\beta_c:=1/\bar\rho_{\max}$ separating two qualitatively different emergent regimes generated from the *same* primitives:
• Subcritical ($\beta<\beta_c$): $Z_s^{(\beta)}>0$ everywhere on Ω, so BC2(pass) can hold globally on Ω and there is no horizon proxy (no radius where $v_{\mathrm{char}}/c=\sqrt{Z_s/Z_t}$ vanishes).
• Supercritical ($\beta>\beta_c$): there exists a (θ-invariantly reportable) radius $r_H$ solving $Z_s^{(\beta)}(\bar\rho(r_H))=0$, so the admissible hyperbolic region (where $Z_s>0$) becomes separated from a non-admissible region (where BC2 fails), and $r_H$ is a natural horizon proxy.

Operational interpretation. This is a controllable bifurcation / phase-like transition in the *emergent causal-structure diagnostic* (horizon proxy present vs absent) driven by a single declared control knob $\beta$, with the primitives held fixed. In a full run, the “order parameter” can be taken as the existence of a finite $r_H$ (or equivalently whether $\min_{x\in\Omega} Z_s^{(\beta)}(\bar\rho(x))$ is positive vs crosses zero), and the pipeline reports the regime through the gate state (BC2 pass/fail) plus, when defined, the normalized discontinuity location $\kappa=\ell^*/r_H$.

• Projection kernel Π(·|u;θ): for each (u,θ), a probability measure on 𝓜 (a Markov kernel 𝒦×Θ→𝒫(𝓜)).

D1 (Induced two-point correlator on 𝓜).
For x,y∈𝓜 and θ∈Θ, define
G₂(x,y;θ) := ∬_{𝒦×𝒦} Π(x|u;θ) K(u,v) Π(y|v;θ) ρ_𝒦(u)ρ_𝒦(v) dμ_𝒦(u)dμ_𝒦(v).
(If 𝒦 is discrete, replace integrals by sums with the declared counting/weight measure.)

D2 (Normalization and correlation distance surrogate).
Ĝ₂(x,y;θ) := |G₂(x,y;θ)| / √(G₂(x,x;θ) G₂(y,y;θ)), when the denominator is finite and nonzero.
d_corr(x,y;θ) := −log Ĝ₂(x,y;θ), where defined.

D3 (Projected environment field).
Define a projected scalar field ρ̄(x;θ) by the declared pushforward rule in the main text (see IV.C), i.e. ρ̄ is a Π/ρ_𝒦-derived scalar on 𝓜 used as the argument of deformation functions and gates.

D4 (Inverse-kernel / generator operator).
On the stated domain, define L_ρ as any operator satisfying the formal inverse relation
(L_ρ ∘ G₂)(x,y;θ) = δ_𝓜(x,y)
(with the chosen convention for δ_𝓜 and boundary conditions stated where used).

D5 (Principal symbol and characteristic cone).
Where a principal symbol exists, extract A^{μν}(x) from L_ρ and define deformation functions Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄) (as declared in the main text). Where Z_t>0 and Z_s>0, define v_char/c := √(Z_s/Z_t).

MODEL ECONOMY AND IDENTIFIABILITY (PARAMETER REGISTRY + SLOPPINESS AUDIT).
Purpose. Make parameter economy explicit (A.4/C.2.2) by (i) listing every free function/knob used by the pipeline, (ii) partitioning knobs into primitives vs schemes vs calibrations vs locked parameters, (iii) stating identifiability conditions for the reportable invariants, and (iv) recording which knobs actually matter via a sensitivity/sloppy-model narrative.

E0. What counts as “reportable” (invariants only).
The only headline outputs permitted to appear in claims are the θ-aggregated, scope-gated summaries:
  (I1) step presence/absence in d_s(ℓ) on a declared window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁],
  (I2) sign(Δd_s) on that window,
  (I3) plateau values (d_UV, d_IR) (when plateaus are statistically supported),
  (I4) κ:=ℓ*/r_H (only when ℓ* and r_H are simultaneously well-defined; see P4).
All other degrees of freedom are treated as nuisance unless explicitly elevated below.

E0a. Parameter-elimination example (κ is not a free phenomenological constant).
Purpose. Provide at least one explicit route from the microdescription knobs (P1–P4) to the flagship GW scaling prediction $t_c/M\approx 2\kappa$, in which $\kappa$ is reduced to a function of fewer microparameters (or sharply bounded) under explicit assumptions.

Setup.
Recall $\kappa:=\ell^*/r_H$, where $\ell^*$ is the inferred change-point scale from the $d_s(\ell)$ step discriminator and $r_H$ is the horizon proxy scale used in the GW mapping.

Assumptions (one concrete, falsifiable reduction).
(Aκ.1) Single micro-length control. Restrict the kernel family to a one-lengthscale subfamily $K_{\xi}$ (e.g., Matérn/Gaussian with range parameter $\xi$), and restrict the projection family so that no additional independent lengthscale is introduced (i.e., all projection neighborhoods scale with the same $\xi$ up to fixed, pre-registered constants).
(Aκ.2) Protocol-fixed definition of $\ell^*$ in terms of $\xi$. Fix the step-location convention (midpoint-crossing or maximum curvature of $d_s(\ell)$) so that, in the idealized/noise-free limit, the step location scales as
\[ \ell^* \;=\; a_{\ell}\,\xi, \]
where $a_{\ell}$ is not fit per dataset but is a *definition-level* constant induced by the fixed estimator + step-location convention (hence part of the scheme, not an extra physical parameter).
(Aκ.3) Early-ringdown GR-likeness bounds $\xi/r_H$. Impose the paper’s stated physical desideratum that early ringdown is GR-like and deviations are late-time (V.G.11–V.G.12). In the simplest perturbative mapping (toy but explicit), take the leading fractional shift in the dominant mode to scale as
\[ \frac{\delta f_{220}}{f_{220}} \;\approx\; c_f\,\Big(\frac{\xi}{r_H}\Big)^2, \]
with $c_f=\mathrm{O}(1)$ determined by the fixed mapping choice (not tuned per event). If external tests-of-GR constrain stationary frequency shifts to be below a conservative budget $\epsilon_{\mathrm{GR}}$ (treated as an *external calibration* input), then
\[ \frac{\xi}{r_H} \;\lesssim\; \sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{GR}}/c_f}. \]

Elimination/bounding result.
Under (Aκ.1–Aκ.3),
\[ \kappa \;=\; \frac{\ell^*}{r_H} \;=\; a_{\ell}\,\frac{\xi}{r_H} \;\lesssim\; a_{\ell}\,\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{GR}}/c_f}. \]
Thus $\kappa$ is not chosen freely: it is (i) determined by the single micro-length $\xi$ once $a_{\ell}$ is fixed by protocol, and (ii) bounded by an external GR-consistency budget $\epsilon_{\mathrm{GR}}$.

Concrete numeric illustration (order-of-magnitude; for budgeting only).
If one adopts a conservative external budget $\epsilon_{\mathrm{GR}}\sim 0.03$ (3%) and $c_f\sim 1$, then $\xi/r_H\lesssim 0.17$ and hence $\kappa\lesssim 0.17\,a_{\ell}$. For a typical step-location convention yielding $a_{\ell}\sim 5$, this implies $\kappa\lesssim 0.85$, i.e., the flagship scaling $t_c/M\approx 2\kappa$ is compatible with $t_c/M=\mathrm{O}(1)$ without treating $\kappa$ as an unconstrained constant.

Audit note.
This “parameter-elimination” example is deliberately explicit about what is being assumed: a single controlling micro-lengthscale $\xi$, a protocol-fixed mapping $\ell^*=a_{\ell}\xi$, and an externally constrained GR-likeness budget. If any assumption fails (e.g., $\ell^*$ depends on additional independent microparameters, or the early-ringdown bound does not translate into a clean $\xi/r_H$ constraint), then $\kappa$ must be promoted back to a multi-parameter function $\kappa=\kappa(\eta,\xi,\dots)$ and reported with the corresponding identifiability/sloppiness caveats.

E1. Registry: exhaustive list of free functions/knobs.
(1) Primitive-level (ontology-layer) knobs.
  P1. Kernel microclass and internal hyperparameters: K∈{K_η} with η describing kernel family choice (e.g., Gaussian/Matérn/power-law/compact-support) and any smoothness/lengthscale parameters.
  P2. Projection family and its internal parameterization: Π(·|u;θ) with θ∈Θ, including the functional family of Π and any structural constraints (e.g., locality/Markovianity, equivariance, bounded support).
  P3. Projection mediator / gauge prior: ν_Θ (≡Λ), including its support and tail behavior.
  P4. Constraint population density: ρ_𝒦(u), including any parametric family ρ_𝒦(u;ξ) or update rule.
  P5. Declared patch and boundary conditions: Ω and boundary condition convention on ∂Ω.

(2) Scheme-level (estimator/regularization/reporting) knobs.
  S1. θ-aggregation functional 𝔄_θ[·] (mean/median/trimmed mean/worst-case/credible interval) and stability metric choice.
  S2. Inversion scheme for L_ρ: exact inverse vs pseudoinverse; Tikhonov λ; SVD cutoff τ; any whitening/conditioning step; retained subspace definition.
  S3. Heat-trace / spectral-dimension estimator: trace estimator type; ℓ-grid; smoothing/windowing; derivative estimator; bootstrap/jackknife policy.
  S4. Step model family and smooth alternatives: parametric form, change-point prior (if Bayesian), loss function, and decision statistic (ΔAIC/ΔBIC/Bayes factor) used to decide “step present.”
  S5. Null/baseline generator family: shuffles, phase randomization, surrogate kernels, time-scrambles, synthetic-controls; number of null draws and p-value calibration.
  S6. RG/coarse-graining choices (when used): blocking map, scale parameter, and the definition of “flow”/fixed point used in diagnostics.

(3) Calibration knobs (fit-to-data within a declared non-peeking rule).
  C1. Any hyperparameters chosen by a data-dependent rule (cross-validation, held-out reconstruction error, empirical-Bayes, marginal likelihood), including λ(·), τ(·), smoothing bandwidths, and step-model priors.
  C2. Any horizon proxy conventions (if κ is reported): definition of r_H, thresholds for BC2/horizon admissibility, and any mapping ρ̄↦(Z_t,Z_s) that contains tunable constants (e.g., β in the toy example).

(4) Locked parameters (fixed by policy; not tuned per dataset).
  L1. Reporting policy: only θ-aggregated invariants are reportable; qualitative flips across reasonable θ variants constitute failure.
  L2. Gate policy: BC1/BC2 (and any additional BC*) are treated as claim-permission gates, not as tunable preferences.
  L3. Decision thresholds: default conservative thresholds (θ-invariance, step-vs-smooth preference, null-test significance) unless explicitly overridden and justified.

E2. Partition rule (primitive vs scheme vs calibration vs locked).
Rule. A knob is classified as primitive if changing it changes the induced correlator family G₂ itself at fixed reporting/estimator choices; it is scheme if it changes only the numerical/statistical map from fixed G₂ to reported summaries; it is calibration if it is selected by a declared data-dependent rule within a fixed scheme; and it is locked if it is fixed by manuscript policy and not tuned per dataset.

E3. Identifiability targets and nuisance families.
Fix (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) and a declared nuisance family 𝒩 consisting of admissible choices of (S1–S6) and (C1–C2) that satisfy the gate preconditions and “reasonable θ-aggregation” constraints. Identifiability is always meant relative to 𝒩.

Definition (𝒩-identifiability of an invariant).
An invariant I∈{I1–I4} is 𝒩-identifiable on (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) if, for all nuisance choices n,n'∈𝒩, the reported value agrees:
  I(n)=I(n')  (exactly for qualitative invariants; within a stated tolerance for numeric plateau values and κ).

Proposition E1 (Identifiability of step presence/absence I1).
Sufficient conditions.
  (E1.a) θ-stability: the step decision agrees across the declared θ-aggregation variants (S1) and across θ-resamples (bootstrap over θ where applicable).
  (E1.b) Scheme robustness: across the declared inversion/estimator family (S2–S3) and its calibrated hyperparameters (C1), the step-vs-smooth preference remains in the same direction (e.g., ΔAIC_step>10 or Bayes factor>10) and the inferred change-point location ℓ* remains within a tolerance band.
  (E1.c) Baseline specificity: the same decision rule fails to trigger on the declared null/baseline family (S5) at the chosen α (e.g., p_null≤0.05).
Conclusion. Under (E1.a–c), “step present” is reportable and is 𝒩-identifiable for the declared 𝒩; if any condition fails, I1 is non-identifiable and must be reported only as “scheme-dependent/unstable.”

Corollary E1.1 (Identifiability of sign(Δd_s) I2).
If I1 is 𝒩-identifiable and the sign of the fitted step height (or of Δd_s estimated by the protocol in V.G.5) does not flip across 𝒩, then sign(Δd_s) is 𝒩-identifiable; otherwise it is not reportable as an invariant.

Proposition E2 (Identifiability of plateau values I3).
Sufficient conditions.
  (E2.a) Plateau detectability: there exist subwindows [ℓ_a,ℓ_b]⊂[ℓ₀,ℓ₁] such that d_s(ℓ) is statistically consistent with a constant over each plateau (lack-of-fit test passes; slope consistent with 0 within tolerance).
  (E2.b) Window robustness: the plateau estimates are stable under small perturbations of [ℓ_a,ℓ_b] and under the declared estimator family (S3) and inversion family (S2), within stated uncertainty.
Conclusion. Under (E2.a–b), (d_UV,d_IR) are 𝒩-identifiable up to the declared tolerance; otherwise only qualitative statements (“crossover present”) are permitted.

Proposition E3 (Identifiability of κ I4).
Sufficient conditions.
  (E3.a) ℓ* is 𝒩-identifiable (from E1/E1.1).
  (E3.b) r_H is 𝒩-identifiable under the declared cone/horizon proxy convention (C2) and BC2(pass) is stable on Ω.
  (E3.c) Ratio stability: κ varies by less than a declared tolerance (default 20%) across 𝒩.
Conclusion. Only under (E3.a–c) is κ reportable as an invariant; otherwise κ must be omitted or labeled scheme-dependent.

E4. Sensitivity / sloppy-model narrative (what knobs actually matter).
The practical economy claim is that most knobs are “sloppy” directions: they move intermediate reconstructions but not the invariant tuple (I1–I4), once gates and θ-stability are enforced.

Operational sloppy-model audit (required reporting).
For each dataset/Ω/window, include a one-page sensitivity registry:
  (SEN-1) Vary each primitive knob family (P1–P4) within a declared neighborhood and report whether any invariant in (I1–I4) changes; if yes, that knob is a “stiff” direction.
  (SEN-2) Vary each scheme knob (S1–S6) within 𝒩 and report the θ-stability metric and any qualitative flips.
  (SEN-3) Provide a ranked list of knobs by their influence on (I1–I4) (e.g., using one-at-a-time perturbations or a Morris screening), and explicitly state the top 3 “matters” knobs for that run.

Interpretation rule.
• If only scheme knobs move intermediate quantities but not (I1–I4), the model is effectively economical for the stated task.
• If primitive knobs (P1–P4) must be tuned to obtain (I1–I4), then the discriminator is not economical and the result must be labeled “calibration-sensitive” (and should not be used as a headline claim).

UV COMPLETION STATUS (DEDICATED; WHAT IS AND IS NOT DEFINED AS ℓ→0).
Status statement.
PCT as specified here is a *finite-resolution, regulator-explicit* construction: the pipeline defines quantities on declared (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) and under stated microclass/integrability/regularization conditions, but it does not (yet) constitute a proven UV-complete theory in the sense of a unique, regulator-independent continuum limit.

UV pathology checklist (mandatory preflight before any “UV/short-scale” claim).
Flag and record a failure mode (and the remediation used) whenever any of the following occurs on the stated (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) and estimator/mesh:
• (UV-P1) Diagonal pathology of G₂: divergence of G₂(x,x;θ), collapse to 0, or numerically unstable cancellation that makes Ĝ₂ or d_corr ill-defined.
• (UV-P2) Inverse non-existence / ill-conditioning: G₂ (as an operator/kernel on the chosen discretization of Ω) is singular or near-singular so that L_ρ cannot be defined as a stable inverse without regularization.
• (UV-P3) Spectrum non-compactness / trace pathology: L_ρ has spectrum/conditioning such that Tr(e^{−ℓ²L_ρ}) is undefined/unstable (e.g., no effective cutoff, runaway negative modes, or failure of numerical trace estimators).

Uniform regularization policy (used throughout unless explicitly overridden).
When any UV-P* issue is present, the manuscript uses a single, declared regularization stack and reports its hyperparameters alongside every affected figure/table:
(1) Heat-kernel regularization for trace-based observables (default).
• All heat-trace quantities are computed from the regulated operator L_ρ,reg inside the semigroup: Tr(e^{−ℓ²L_ρ,reg}).
• In discretized runs, the trace is taken over the retained spectral subspace after the inversion regularization below.

(2) Tikhonov-regularized inverse for defining L_ρ (default).
• Define L_ρ,reg as the (unique) minimizer of ||G₂ f − g||² + λ||f||², equivalently the operator (G₂^T G₂ + λ I)^{-1} G₂^T on the declared discretization.
• λ>0 is chosen by a declared, non-peeking rule (e.g., fixed fraction of the median singular value squared, or a held-out reconstruction error criterion); the rule and numeric value are reported.

(3) Spectral pseudoinverse cutoff (fallback / auditing).
• If SVD/eigendecomposition is used, impose a hard cutoff: retain modes with s_i/s_max ≥ τ and define the pseudoinverse on the retained subspace.
• The cutoff τ and the retained-rank fraction are reported; conclusions that change qualitatively under a reasonable τ range are labeled scheme-dependent.

Reporting requirements.
• Every time L_ρ appears in a computation, explicitly tag it as L_ρ,reg and cite the (λ,τ) (or whichever subset applies) plus the discretization/estimator identifiers.
• Any “UV” claim must include a short note stating whether UV-P1–UV-P3 were all clear; if not, which remediation(s) were used and which outputs are considered scheme-dependent.

UV toy example (analytic, full pipeline; shows “well-behaved UV” and what failure looks like).
Goal. Provide one case where every stage (D1–D4 → heat trace → $d_s(\ell)$) is computable in closed form (or near-closed form), so “UV” language is explicitly tied to the stated regularization and to UV-P* flags.

Setup (translation-invariant continuum toy model).
• Take $\mathcal K=\mathcal M=\mathbb R$ (1D), $\mu_{\mathcal K}=du$, and a constant constraint density $\rho_{\mathcal K}(u)=\rho_0>0$.
• Take a trivial projection (identity pushforward): $\Pi(x\mid u;\theta)=\delta(x-u)$ for all $\theta$ (θ becomes inert; R1 is trivially satisfied).
• Choose a Gaussian kernel microclass with UV length $\sigma>0$:
  $K(u,v)=\exp\!\left(-\frac{(u-v)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$.

Stage D1 (pushforward correlator).
With the identity projection, $G_2(x,y;\theta)$ becomes (up to the constant prefactor $\rho_0^2$)
  $G_2(x,y)=\rho_0^2\,\exp\!\left(-\frac{(x-y)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$.
UV-P1 check: $G_2(x,x)=\rho_0^2$ is finite and nonzero, so the diagonal is well-behaved.

Stage D4 (inverse/generator in Fourier space).
As an integral operator on $L^2(\mathbb R)$, $G_2$ is a convolution with a Gaussian, so in Fourier space
  $\widehat{G_2}(k)=\rho_0^2\,\sqrt{2\pi}\,\sigma\,e^{-\sigma^2 k^2/2}$.
The formal inverse has symbol
  $\widehat{L_\rho}(k)=1/\widehat{G_2}(k)=\frac{1}{\rho_0^2\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}\,e^{+\sigma^2 k^2/2}$,
so $L_\rho$ exists as a *regularized* pseudodifferential operator but is UV-amplifying at large $|k|$. This is precisely where the “finite-resolution, regulator-explicit” policy matters.
UV-P2 check: no exact zero modes occur, but the inverse is exponentially ill-conditioned as $|k|\to\infty$, so a cutoff/Tikhonov regularization is mandatory for any finite-mesh computation.

Heat trace and $d_s(\ell)$ with an explicit UV cutoff (audited scheme).
Impose the spectral cutoff policy (3) with $|k|\le k_{\max}$ (equivalently, retain modes above a fixed SVD threshold on a mesh). Then
  $\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-\ell^2 L_{\rho,\mathrm{reg}}})\;\propto\;\int_{-k_{\max}}^{k_{\max}}\exp\!\left[-\ell^2\,\widehat{L_\rho}(k)\right]dk.$
As $\ell\to 0$ with fixed $k_{\max}$, the integrand tends to 1 and the trace tends to $2k_{\max}$ (finite, regulator-dependent), yielding $d_s(\ell)\to 0$ in this strict “resolution-limited UV” sense. This is a *well-behaved* UV limit (no divergence), but it is explicitly *scheme-dependent* because it depends on $k_{\max}$ (or equivalently on τ / mesh scale).
UV-P3 check: the regulated trace is finite for every $\ell>0$ and remains finite as $\ell\to 0$ at fixed cutoff.

What failure looks like (and how the gate flags it).
If instead one chooses a kernel with a diagonal divergence, e.g. a singular short-distance form $K(u,v)\propto |u-v|^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha\ge 1$ in 1D, then $G_2(x,x)$ diverges and $\hat G_2$ is ill-defined: UV-P1 is triggered and any “UV” statement is prohibited unless a renormalized definition of the diagonal/normalization is declared (OP-UV1). If one chooses a kernel whose Fourier transform has zeros (e.g. oscillatory kernels with sign changes), UV-P2 is triggered because exact null modes make $L_\rho$ undefined without a declared pseudoinverse scheme.

Defined in this manuscript (finite-scale / conditional).
• Pushforward correlator G₂(x,y;θ) is defined whenever the 𝒦×𝒦 integral/sum converges under the stated μ_𝒦, ρ_𝒦, Π, and kernel microclass assumptions.
• Distance surrogate d_corr and any BC1-gated geometric proxies are defined only on the subset where normalization denominators are finite/nonzero and the BC1 admissibility checks pass.
• The inverse/generator L_ρ is used only in the regularized/pseudoinverse sense declared for the analysis (cutoff/Tikhonov/heat-kernel regularization as specified where applied), and only on the stated domain/boundary conditions.
• Heat-trace quantities (Tr(e^{−ℓ²L_ρ}), d_s(ℓ), and step diagnostics) are defined only for the declared estimator + regularization choice and only over the stated window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁].

Not defined / not proved at arbitrarily short scales (UV gaps).
• No existence/uniqueness proof is given for a regulator-independent limit of the full pipeline as ℓ→0 (or as any underlying discretization scale →0 / constraint count →∞).
• No constructive renormalization/coarse-graining map is specified that would relate (𝒦,K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ) across scales and yield fixed points or scaling laws.
• No theorem is provided guaranteeing existence, boundedness, self-adjointness, or unique invertibility of L_ρ without a regularization prescription; in general G₂ may be non-invertible or only invertible on a restricted subspace.
• No proof is given that headline discriminator outputs are scheme-independent under changes of admissible kernel/projection/inversion families beyond what is explicitly audited in the scheme-dependence registry.

Matter / Standard Model unification (explicit scope boundary).
This manuscript does not attempt unification with matter, embedding of the Standard Model, or derivation of gauge/fermion content; therefore it makes no claims about gauge group emergence, chiral structure, anomaly cancellation, Yukawa structure, coupling unification, neutrino sector, dark matter, or any other SM-completion feature.

Minimum next-paper deliverables to raise A.9 (Unification with matter / SM embedding) from 2/10 to ≥4/10.
(D-M1) Define a concrete matter-sector representation: a map from PCT primitives (𝒦,K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ and derived objects) to candidate matter degrees of freedom, including what counts as a “field”, “charge”, and “interaction” operationally.
(D-M2) State the symmetry target and recovery criterion: specify the candidate emergent gauge symmetry (at least U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3) or a clearly justified alternative) and a testable criterion for approximate recovery in an IR regime (e.g., Ward-identity checks / invariants under a declared transformation family).
(D-M3) Couple matter to the emergent geometric diagnostics: give an explicit prescription for how the matter sector sees the BC-gated geometry/casual structure (what replaces minimal coupling, what is held fixed across θ, and how scheme dependence is audited).
(D-M4) Provide at least one nontrivial consistency check that can fail: e.g., chirality + anomaly cancellation in the effective theory, or a no-go result that rules out a matter representation class.
(D-M5) Produce at least one quantitative, non-calibration matter-sector discriminator: a prediction or constraint (with uncertainty + null test) that distinguishes the proposed matter embedding from a baseline (SM-on-GR or another comparator), using the same “discriminator-first” reporting policy.
(D-M6) Include a minimal reproducible demonstration (synthetic or public data analogue) showing the full mapping end-to-end for one small instance, with code/data provenance and sensitivity to analyst degrees of freedom audited.

Standard Model / matter embedding interface spec (minimal, operational; not full unification).
Purpose. Provide a concrete *interface* (not a completion) that lets one couple an effective matter sector to the BC-gated geometric proxies produced by the PCT pipeline. The goal is to make “matter coupling” falsifiable early, without requiring derivation of the full SM.

Scope statement (explicit).
• This section specifies an interface prescription only (DEF where stated). It does not derive the SM gauge group, chirality, anomaly cancellation, Yukawas, or coupling unification.
• Any claim beyond the interface (e.g., SM group emergence) remains a placeholder (PH) unless explicitly derived/proved elsewhere.

I. Matter DOFs in the primitive language (DEF).
A minimal representation that is compatible with PCT’s correlator-first pipeline is:
• Choose a discrete effective support Ω (e.g., the same Ω used for heat-trace estimation) and define a weighted graph/complex 𝒢=(Ω,E,w) induced by the correlation-distance surrogate d_corr (or by the kernel Ĝ₂ itself):
  – Edge rule (example): (x,y)∈E iff d_corr(x,y)≤ε_edge and BC1 passes on the relevant neighborhood; set w_{xy}:=exp(−d_corr(x,y)^2/2σ_m^2).
• Define matter fields as sections over Ω:
  – Scalar: φ:Ω→ℂ.
  – Fermion surrogate (minimal placeholder): ψ:Ω→ℂ^n with a declared finite-dimensional internal space; a true spin structure is PH until a spin-connection proxy is derived.
  – Gauge field: link variables U_{xy}∈G on edges (x,y)∈E (with G a chosen target group; see II).

Interface rule (minimal coupling; DEF).
Given the PCT-induced generator/Laplacian proxy L_{ρ,reg} (or its graph analogue Δ_𝒢), define the covariant kinetic term by replacing finite differences with link-parallel transport:
  (Dψ)_{x} := ∑_{y:(x,y)∈E} w_{xy} (U_{xy} ψ_y − ψ_x),
and analogously for φ. The free matter action is then
  S_matter := ∑_{x∈Ω} (Dφ)_x^* (Dφ)_x + m^2 |φ_x|^2  +  ψ̄_x (𝒟_𝒢[U] ψ)_x,
where 𝒟_𝒢 is a declared graph-Dirac surrogate (PH unless a spin/Clifford proxy is derived).

II. Gauge invariance representation / recovery (DEF + REC).
Representation (DEF).
• Local gauge transformation at nodes: g:Ω→G.
• Matter transforms as ψ_x→g_x ψ_x (and φ_x→g_x φ_x for charged scalars).
• Links transform as U_{xy}→g_x U_{xy} g_y^{-1}.
Under these rules, S_matter is exactly invariant by construction on the discrete Ω/𝒢.

Recovery criterion (REC; what would count as “approximate gauge symmetry in the IR”).
Declare a low-energy/large-ℓ regime (window [ℓ_IR,ℓ_UV] and patch Ω) where:
• Ward-identity proxy holds within tolerance: for a chosen set of test functions J (currents) and variations δ_g, the measured gauge-variation estimator satisfies
  ||δ_g ⟨𝒪⟩|| ≤ ε_WI  for all g in an admissible local family,
with (ε_WI, the observable family 𝒪, and the test set) declared.
• The result must be θ-invariant: the Ward proxy and ε_WI classification must be stable under θ-aggregation variants (R1).

III. Most discriminating observational constraints (what to test first).
These are constraints on the *interface* (coupling + symmetry recovery), not on SM completion.
1) Lorentz/dispersion constraints (fastest hard falsifiers if the interface predicts modified propagation).
   If the covariant kinetic operator built from L_{ρ,reg} produces energy-dependent group velocity (or birefringence/polarization rotation) at an amplitude exceeding existing bounds, the interface is ruled out (or must be restricted to a regime where the effect is absent).
2) Equivalence-principle / universality of free fall (interface-level).
   The same BC-gated geometry/proxy used to define matter propagation must couple universally to all matter representations used (scalars/fermions) up to declared tolerances; any composition-dependent propagation at leading order is a hard failure unless explicitly engineered and bounded.
3) Gauge-charge conservation / current continuity (interface-level).
   On Ω, the discrete continuity equation derived from gauge invariance must be satisfied by the estimator outputs (within ε_WI) across θ variants and scheme variations.
4) Running / scale dependence tied to PCT diagnostics.
   If the interface ties effective couplings to PCT scale diagnostics (e.g., d_s(ℓ) or a step at ℓ*), then the implied running must not contradict precision constraints in the probed regime; otherwise the proposed tie is PH and must be labeled as such.

IV. Derived vs placeholder inventory (mandatory labels).
Derived here (DEF).
• A matter-interface on Ω defined by (i) an induced support graph 𝒢 from d_corr/Ĝ₂ and (ii) link-based minimal coupling using U_{xy} and weights w_{xy}.
• Exact discrete gauge invariance of S_matter under node-wise transformations, by construction.

Placeholders (PH; not derived in this manuscript).
• Choice of gauge group G beyond a minimal U(1) pilot.
• A true spin structure / chiral fermions / anomaly cancellation / Yukawa sector.
• Any identification of specific SM fields or coupling values.

Near-term falsifier that does not require full unification (cheap to run).
(U1) U(1) Ward-identity + θ-stability test (end-to-end on a runnable channel).
Protocol.
• Pick one runnable pipeline instance (toy analogue DS, GW pilot slice, or CMB pilot) and one declared Ω and ℓ-window.
• Build 𝒢 from d_corr and define a U(1) link field by extracting an edge phase from the θ-aggregated correlator, e.g.
    U_{xy} := exp(i arg Ĝ₂(x,y))  (after a declared phase-unwrapping convention).
• Compute the discrete gauge-variation proxy for a fixed set of local phase perturbations α_x (so g_x:=e^{iα_x}) and a fixed observable family 𝒪 (e.g., heat-trace summaries for the covariant Laplacian, a current divergence statistic, and one two-point function).
Decision rule (hard stop).
• Fail the interface if the Ward proxy exceeds ε_WI for any admissible perturbation family *or* if the pass/fail outcome is not θ-invariant under the declared θ-aggregation variants.
This falsifier only tests interface consistency (gauge invariance recovery + θ-invariance) and does not require identifying the SM group or fermion content.

UV COMPLETION OBLIGATION LIST (OP-UV1–OP-UV5) (FORMAL).
Purpose. Collect the *minimal* additional axioms/hypotheses required to promote the regulator-explicit, finite-scale pipeline into a mathematically controlled UV completion claim. Each obligation is stated as a theorem-style item: it is an “obligation” on any candidate microclass (𝒦,K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ) and on the chosen Ω/boundary conditions.

Convention (ambient Hilbert space).
Fix a declared patch Ω⊂𝓜 with reference measure μ_Ω (counting measure for discrete Ω; volume measure for continuum Ω). Let H:=L^2(Ω,dμ_Ω). The pushforward correlator defines an integral kernel G₂(x,y;θ) on Ω×Ω and induces an operator (G₂,θ f)(x):=∫_Ω G₂(x,y;θ) f(y) dμ_Ω(y) (or a sum for discrete Ω). Let Ĝ₂(x,y):=𝔄_θ[G₂(x,y;θ)] denote the declared θ-aggregation (R1).

(Obligation OP-UV1: Renormalized diagonal / normalized correlator.)
Statement. Provide hypotheses ensuring that a *renormalized* θ-aggregated correlator Ĝ₂,ren exists as a measurable kernel on Ω×Ω with a well-defined, finite diagonal normalization used in D2/D3.
Minimal hypotheses (one sufficient set).
  (H1.1) For μ_Ω×μ_Ω-a.e. (x,y), Ĝ₂(x,y) is finite and symmetric: Ĝ₂(x,y)=Ĝ₂(y,x).
  (H1.2) There exists a declared renormalization/normalization prescription N_ε acting on the diagonal (or short-distance ball) such that the limit exists:
         Ĝ₂,ren(x,y):=lim_{ε→0} N_ε[Ĝ₂](x,y)  (existence in L^1_loc(Ω×Ω) or pointwise a.e.).
  (H1.3) The normalized denominator used by d_corr is nonzero and finite on Ω: 0<Ĝ₂,ren(x,x)<∞ for μ_Ω-a.e. x, and likewise for y.
Consequence. d_corr and all BC1-gated geometry statements become well-defined on the declared domain of validity.

(Obligation OP-UV2: Existence/uniqueness of L_ρ (invertibility / controlled pseudoinverse).)
Statement. Specify minimal conditions under which the (renormalized) correlator operator G:=G₂,ren (or its θ-aggregate Ĝ:=Ĝ₂,ren) admits a controlled inverse/pseudoinverse defining L_ρ.
Minimal hypotheses (one sufficient set).
  (H2.1) (Bounded, positive operator) Ĝ defines a bounded, self-adjoint, positive semidefinite operator on H.
  (H2.2) (Invertibility OR declared null-space handling) Either:
         (i) Ĝ is strictly positive: ⟨f,Ĝ f⟩≥c||f||^2 for some c>0 (hence invertible),
         or (ii) Ker(Ĝ) is characterized and a *unique* scheme for its removal is declared (e.g., Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse on Ker(Ĝ)^⊥, or a Tikhonov family (Ĝ+λI)^{-1} with λ>0).
  (H2.3) (Stability) The inversion scheme is stable on the reportable subspace: there exists a declared class of test functions/observables 𝒪⊂H such that ||L_{ρ,reg} f|| is uniformly bounded (in λ/τ cutoffs) for f∈𝒪 over the stated window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁].
Definition/uniqueness. Under (H2.*), define L_ρ either as Ĝ^{-1} (case (i)) or as the declared pseudoinverse/regularized inverse (case (ii)). Uniqueness is with respect to that declared scheme.

(Obligation OP-UV3: Domain, boundary conditions, and self-adjointness of L_ρ.)
Statement. Provide hypotheses ensuring L_ρ is a closed, densely defined (and preferably self-adjoint) operator on H, with explicitly declared boundary conditions on Ω.
Minimal hypotheses (one sufficient set).
  (H3.1) L_ρ is self-adjoint (or essentially self-adjoint on a declared core 𝒟₀⊂H) and lower bounded: ⟨f,L_ρ f⟩≥m||f||^2.
  (H3.2) Boundary conditions on ∂Ω (Dirichlet/Neumann/periodic/graph-boundary convention) are declared and shown compatible with (H3.1).
  (H3.3) Domain control: the declared estimator only uses vectors in Dom(L_ρ) (or in the quadratic-form domain when using form methods).
Consequence. Spectral calculus for L_ρ is well-defined and the “generator” language is justified (at least conditionally on the stated BCs).

(Obligation OP-UV4: Spectral/semigroup properties sufficient for Tr(e^{−ℓ² L_ρ}).)
Statement. Provide sufficient conditions ensuring that for every ℓ in the declared window (and, for UV completion, as ℓ→0 in the declared refinement limit) the heat operator e^{−ℓ²L_ρ} exists and is trace-class on H so that Tr(e^{−ℓ²L_ρ}) is finite and d_s(ℓ) is well-defined.
Minimal hypotheses (one sufficient set).
  (H4.1) L_ρ is nonnegative self-adjoint.
  (H4.2) e^{−tL_ρ} is trace-class for t>0. A sufficient condition is that L_ρ has compact resolvent (e.g., Ω bounded with suitable BCs and L_ρ elliptic-like in the IR), or any other declared criterion guaranteeing trace-class semigroup.
  (H4.3) Small-ℓ control: there exists a declared asymptotic regime (or bound) ensuring Tr(e^{−ℓ²L_ρ}) does not diverge faster than allowed by the intended “UV” statements.
Consequence. The heat-trace estimator is mathematically meaningful (not only numerically regularized) on the stated domain.

(Obligation OP-UV5: Continuum/refinement limit (discretization → continuum; 𝒦 refinement).)
Statement. Provide a refinement family indexed by h→0 or N_𝒦→∞ (and any accompanying regularization parameters) such that L_{ρ,h} converges to a limiting operator L_ρ and the heat traces converge on the declared ℓ-windows.
Minimal hypotheses (one sufficient set).
  (H5.1) (Convergent primitives) A sequence (𝒦_h,K_h,ρ_{𝒦,h},Π_h,ν_{Θ,h}) is specified with μ_{𝒦,h}→μ_𝒦 and ρ_{𝒦,h}→ρ_𝒦 in a mode strong enough to pass limits through D1 (e.g., dominated convergence assumptions).
  (H5.2) (Operator convergence) The induced Ĝ_h converge to Ĝ in operator topology sufficient to imply resolvent/semigroup convergence (e.g., strong resolvent convergence for L_{ρ,h}).
  (H5.3) (Heat-trace convergence) For each fixed ℓ>0 in the stated window, Tr(e^{−ℓ²L_{ρ,h}})→Tr(e^{−ℓ²L_ρ}), and the convergence is uniform on compact ℓ-intervals needed for differentiating log Tr to define d_s(ℓ).
Consequence. “UV limit” claims can be phrased as statements about the limiting operator (and not solely about regulator-dependent finite-N behavior).

WHAT IS PROVED VS ASSUMED LEDGER (PER OBLIGATION).
Ledger rule. A claim of “UV completeness/consistency” (A.1) is permitted only if, for each OP-UVk, the manuscript either proves the listed hypotheses for the declared microclass *or* explicitly flags them as assumptions and labels all downstream UV-facing outputs as scheme-/assumption-dependent.

OP-UV1 ledger.
  Proved here: none (only diagnostic flags UV-P1 and regulator-explicit normalization policies).
  Assumed/required for completion: existence of Ĝ₂,ren and finite/nonzero diagonal normalization on Ω.

OP-UV2 ledger.
  Proved here: none (only declares inversion schemes and audits ill-conditioning in UV-P2).
  Assumed/required for completion: boundedness/positivity of Ĝ, characterization of Ker(Ĝ), and stability of the chosen inverse/pseudoinverse on the reportable observable class 𝒪.

OP-UV3 ledger.
  Proved here: none (only uses L_{ρ,reg} in a declared scheme sense).
  Assumed/required for completion: explicit boundary conditions on Ω and self-adjointness / closedness of L_ρ on the stated domain.

OP-UV4 ledger.
  Proved here: none (heat trace is treated as an estimator output under declared regularization).
  Assumed/required for completion: trace-class property of e^{−tL_ρ} (t>0) and small-ℓ control sufficient to justify d_s(ℓ) without regulator dependence.

OP-UV5 ledger.
  Proved here: none (no continuum/refinement theorem is given).
  Assumed/required for completion: existence of a refinement family with operator/heat-trace convergence adequate to define a regulator-independent UV limit.

RENORMALIZATION / COARSE-GRAINING MAP (MODULE RG; EXPLICIT).
Purpose. Provide a single declared coarse-graining operator on the full primitive tuple (𝒦,K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ) so that statements about “UV vs IR” or “flow across scales” can be phrased as invariance/fixed-point targets for observable diagnostics, rather than as estimator artifacts.

RG0 (Choice of coarse-graining scale and cover).
Fix a coarse-graining factor b>1 and a measurable family of nonnegative “block weights” {w_a(u)}_{a∈𝒦_b} on 𝒦 satisfying a partition-of-unity condition
  ∑_{a∈𝒦_b} w_a(u) = 1  (μ_𝒦-a.e.),
with each w_a supported on a “cell” of typical diameter ~b in whatever intrinsic notion of neighborhood is declared for 𝒦 (graph distance, coordinate cover, clustering rule, etc.). The coarse-grained constraint space is the index set 𝒦_b.

RG1 (Coarse-grained density and measure).
Define the coarse-grained density ρ_{𝒦_b} and induced measure μ_{𝒦_b} by pushforward through the weights:
  ρ_{𝒦_b}(a) := ∫_{𝒦} w_a(u)
                ρ_𝒦(u)
                dμ_𝒦(u),
with μ_{𝒦_b} taken as counting measure on 𝒦_b unless another choice is explicitly declared.

RG2 (Coarse-grained kernel).
Define the block-averaged kernel K_b on 𝒦_b×𝒦_b by
  K_b(a,c) := ∬_{𝒦×𝒦} w_a(u)
              K(u,v)
              w_c(v)
              dμ_𝒦(u)dμ_𝒦(v).
If the microclass requires a normalization (e.g., to keep K_b PSD or to preserve a chosen diagonal convention), declare the normalization here; otherwise the default is the raw block average above.

RG3 (Coarse-grained projection kernel).
Define a coarse-grained projection Π_b by mixing the original Π over each block:
  Π_b(x|a;θ) := (1/ρ_{𝒦_b}(a)) ∫_{𝒦} w_a(u)
                Π(x|u;θ)
                ρ_𝒦(u)
                dμ_𝒦(u),
whenever ρ_{𝒦_b}(a)>0 (if ρ_{𝒦_b}(a)=0, remove that block from 𝒦_b or define Π_b arbitrarily and exclude it by gate).

RG4 (Coarse-grained θ-mediator).
Default choice (used unless overridden): ν_Θ is unchanged under coarse-graining (ν_{Θ,b} := ν_Θ). If a θ-reparametrization θ↦θ_b is introduced, ν_{Θ,b} is defined as the pushforward of ν_Θ through that map, and the map must be stated explicitly.

RG5 (Induced correlator and operator flow).
Given (𝒦_b,K_b,ρ_{𝒦_b},Π_b,ν_{Θ,b}), define G_{2,b}, Ĝ_{2,b}, d_{corr,b}, and L_{ρ,b} by the same D1–D4 definitions as at the fine level.

RG6 (Invariance targets (what counts as “RG-consistent”)).
The coarse-graining map is declared successful on (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) only if at least one of the invariance targets (T1–T3) holds under stated hypotheses. This subsection formalizes the logical pipeline: (i) a coarse-graining map on primitives, (ii) induced flow of the reported operator/observables, (iii) invariance targets as theorems with explicit finite-N checkability.

Definitions (RG-consistency objects).
• Let L_ρ be the fine-level induced operator (RG5), and L_{ρ,b} the coarse-grained induced operator.
• Let H(ℓ):=\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-\ell^2 L_\rho}) and H_b(ℓ):=\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-\ell^2 L_{\rho,b}}).
• Define spectral dimension by the manuscript’s fixed estimator convention:
  d_s(\ell):=-2\,\frac{\partial \log H(\ell)}{\partial \log(\ell^2)}\quad\text{and}\quad d_{s,b}(\ell):=-2\,\frac{\partial \log H_b(\ell)}{\partial \log(\ell^2)}.
• Let I_step denote the step-vs-smooth decision functional used elsewhere in the paper (same decision rule pre/post coarse-graining).

Lemma RG-L1 (Semigroup/heat-trace stability under operator convergence).
Hypotheses.
  (L1.a) L_{\rho,b} and L_\rho are nonnegative self-adjoint on the declared domain, and e^{-tL} is trace-class for every t>0.
  (L1.b) (Coarse-grain→fine matching) There exists a rescaling map S_b on the ℓ-axis and a (possibly calibrated) exponent η such that, on the declared overlap window, the semigroups satisfy
        e^{-\ell^2 L_{\rho,b}} \approx e^{-(\ell/b)^2\, b^{\eta} L_\rho}
        in trace norm (or in a sufficient operator topology to control traces) uniformly on ℓ in the overlap window.
Conclusion.
  (C1) Heat traces match up to the induced rescaling:
      H_b(\ell) \approx H\bigl((\ell/b)\,b^{\eta/2}\bigr).
  (C2) Differentiating the log-trace yields the corresponding d_s matching relation up to the same tolerance.
Proof sketch.
Trace-class + trace-norm proximity implies |\mathrm{Tr}(A)-\mathrm{Tr}(B)| is bounded by ||A-B||_1; applying this to the semigroup relation and differentiating on the overlap window yields (C1–C2) when the estimator’s differentiation rule is stable (i.e., windowed/log-derivative discretization errors are controlled by the declared scheme family).

Theorem RG-T1 (Invariance target T1: b-covariance scaling law).
Statement (T1).
There exists an exponent η (CAL or DEF, as declared) such that for ℓ in the overlap window,
  d_{s,b}(\ell) \approx d_s(\ell/b)
within the stated reporting tolerance, and I_step(d_{s,b}) = I_step(d_s(\cdot/b)) (step-vs-smooth decision unchanged) under the pair (coarse-grain by b, rescale ℓ→ℓ/b).
Sufficient conditions.
  (T1.a) Lemma RG-L1 hypotheses hold with η and S_b(\ell)=\ell/b.
  (T1.b) Step decision stability: for all θ-aggregation variants and scheme variants in the declared admissible family, the decision margin stays away from the threshold (no “knife-edge” decisions).
Conclusion.
Under (T1.a–b), T1 holds and is RG-consistent on the declared (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]).

Theorem RG-T2 (Invariance target T2: fixed-point/plateau stability).
Statement (T2).
There exists a regime where d_s(\ell) is approximately constant (plateau) and the plateau value is stable under coarse-graining:
  d_{s,b}(\ell) \approx d_s(\ell)
for ℓ in the declared plateau window, within tolerance.
Sufficient conditions.
  (T2.a) Semigroup fixed-point: e^{-\ell^2 L_{\rho,b}} \approx e^{-\ell^2 L_\rho} in trace norm on the plateau window.
  (T2.b) Plateau detectability is satisfied for both fine and coarse traces (same lack-of-fit criteria as Proposition E2).
Conclusion.
Under (T2.a–b), T2 holds and plateau language may be used as an RG-consistent statement on the stated plateau window.

Theorem RG-T3 (Invariance target T3: dimensionless-step stability of κ).
Statement (T3).
When κ is defined (i.e., when both ℓ* and r_H are defined in the same gated regime), require that κ is stable under coarse-graining:
  \kappa_b := \ell^*_b / r_{H,b} \approx \kappa,
with \ell^*_b extracted by the same protocol from d_{s,b}(\ell), and r_{H,b} reconstructed by the same horizon proxy definition applied after coarse-graining.
Sufficient conditions.
  (T3.a) Step identifiability: ℓ* is identifiable at both resolutions (Proposition E1) with decision margins not near threshold.
  (T3.b) Horizon proxy stability: r_H is defined and stable under the declared admissible scheme family (including any coarse-graining dependence of the proxy), and BC2(pass) is stable on the exterior Ω.
  (T3.c) Joint stability: the ratio κ remains stable under the combined admissible variations (θ variants, window shifts, and coarse-graining choices).
Conclusion.
Under (T3.a–c), κ is RG-consistent and reportable as an invariant ratio; otherwise κ must be labeled scheme-dependent or omitted.

What is empirically checkable at finite N (operational meaning of ≈).
Because empirical confrontations occur at finite discretization/resolution, every “≈” above must be reduced to a finite-N acceptance test.

Finite-N acceptance tests (minimal; per target).
• (FN-T1) T1 check at finite N_\mathcal K:
  Evaluate d_s^{(N)}(\ell) and d_{s,b}^{(N)}(\ell) on the overlap window; require
  \max_{\ell\in W}\big|d_{s,b}^{(N)}(\ell)-d_s^{(N)}(\ell/b)\big| \le \varepsilon_{T1}
  and I_step(d_{s,b}^{(N)}) = I_step(d_s^{(N)}(\cdot/b)), with the check repeated across declared θ-variants and scheme variants.

• (FN-T2) T2 check at finite N_\mathcal K:
  On the declared plateau window W_plat, require both (i) plateau detectability (lack-of-fit passes) and (ii)
  \max_{\ell\in W_{\mathrm{plat}}}\big|d_{s,b}^{(N)}(\ell)-d_s^{(N)}(\ell)\big| \le \varepsilon_{T2}.

• (FN-T3) T3 check at finite N_\mathcal K:
  Require κ^{(N)} and κ_b^{(N)} are both defined and satisfy
  \big|\kappa_b^{(N)}-\kappa^{(N)}\big|/\kappa^{(N)} \le \varepsilon_{T3}
  across declared θ-variants and admissible scheme variants.

Default tolerances (unless overridden).
Set \varepsilon_{T1}=0.25, \varepsilon_{T2}=0.25, \varepsilon_{T3}=0.20 as conservative defaults, matching the paper’s qualitative-stability thresholds; tighter values may be declared per channel when signal-to-noise permits.

FINITE-N DIAGNOSTICS (REQUIRED): CONVERGENCE OF \Delta d_s(N_\mathcal K) AND EXTRAPOLATION RULES.
Purpose. Make “continuum/refinement” claims falsifiable by requiring explicit convergence evidence for the step magnitude and (when applicable) its location.

Definitions.
• Let N_\mathcal K denote the resolution parameter for the constraint space discretization (number of nodes, samples, mesh elements, etc., as appropriate).
• Let \Delta d_s(N_\mathcal K) be the step magnitude extracted by the fixed protocol at that resolution.
• Let \ell^*(N_\mathcal K) be the extracted change-point scale (if a step is present).

Required diagnostic outputs (per dataset/channel).
(1) A convergence table.
Table RG-FN1 — Convergence of step summaries with refinement.
N_\mathcal K | \Delta d_s(N_\mathcal K) \pm \sigma | \ell^*(N_\mathcal K) \pm \sigma | step-vs-smooth margin | θ-stability metric
---|---|---|---|---
(fill) | (fill) | (fill) | (fill) | (fill)

(2) A convergence plot (placeholder specification).
Figure RG-FN1 — Plot \Delta d_s(N_\mathcal K) vs 1/N_\mathcal K (or vs h if a mesh spacing exists), with error bars and the chosen extrapolation fit overlaid. (If \ell^* is used, provide an analogous plot for \ell^*(N_\mathcal K).)

Acceptance criterion (convergence).
• Require a stable regime: there exists N_0 such that for all N\ge N_0 in the refinement series,
  |\Delta d_s(2N)-\Delta d_s(N)| \le \varepsilon_{\Delta}(N)
  with \varepsilon_{\Delta}(N) chosen as max(0.25, 2\sigma_{\Delta}(N)) unless a tighter declared rule is used.
• Additionally require that the step decision label does not flip across the refinement series after N_0.

Extrapolation rules (must declare one; no post-hoc switching).
Default extrapolation family (power-law in resolution).
Assume a leading correction of the form
  \Delta d_s(N)=\Delta d_s(\infty)+c\,N^{-p}
with p>0 and fit (\Delta d_s(\infty),c,p) on the largest-m N values (m declared, e.g., m=3–5), reporting fit uncertainty and a leave-one-out stability check.

Alternative (two-point Richardson-style when p is fixed by theory/estimator order).
If the estimator order implies a known p (e.g., p=1 or p=2), use a two-point extrapolation
  \Delta d_s(\infty) \approx \frac{2^p\,\Delta d_s(2N)-\Delta d_s(N)}{2^p-1}
and report consistency across multiple (N,2N) pairs.

No-claim rule.
If the convergence criterion fails or extrapolated values are unstable under the declared leave-one-out audit, then any continuum-limit statement about \Delta d_s (or any locked-choice numerical band depending on it) must be downgraded to “finite-N unresolved” and treated as scheme-dependent (R2).

Reporting requirement.
Whenever a section uses “UV/IR”, “flow”, “coarse-grain”, or “renormalization” language, it must name the RG module used (RG0–RG6), state b and the block-weight rule {w_a}, and cite which invariance target (T1/T2/T3) was checked and whether it passed, including the finite-N diagnostic reference (Table/ Figure RG-FN1) when the claim depends on refinement.

R1 (Reported observables must be θ-invariant).
Any quantity asserted as “physical” must be reported by an explicit θ-aggregation/invariance protocol with respect to ν_Θ (e.g., ν_Θ-averages, ν_Θ-credible intervals, or worst-case over an admissible θ-family).

R2 (Scheme-(in)dependence and headline-claim restriction).
Definition (scheme).
A “scheme” is any declared admissible choice from an implementation family that is not part of the primitive input (𝒦,K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ) but is required to extract/report observables. In this manuscript, the scheme family includes (at minimum): estimator variants for d_s(ℓ) and step extraction (windowing, smoothing/regularization, change-point/step-vs-smooth decision rule identifiers), RG module choice (RG0–RG6) and block parameters (b,{w_a}), outward/admissibility thresholds (e.g., ε_out) where applicable, and any other declared analyst degrees of freedom.

Definition (scheme-invariant vs scheme-dependent).
Let F be the declared admissible family of schemes for a run. An observable O is “scheme-invariant” on (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) if its reported value/decision is stable (within the stated tolerance/uncertainty) under all s∈F, after enforcing θ-invariant reporting (R1) and the relevant BC* gates. Otherwise O is “scheme-dependent.”

Reporting rule (headline restriction).
All headline conclusions (abstract, introduction claims, “main result” bullets, and any “therefore” statements about geometry/horizons/flow) must be stated only in terms of the scheme-invariant set. Scheme-dependent quantities may be reported only as (i) diagnostics, (ii) sensitivity/robustness-audit outputs, or (iii) conditional statements explicitly labeled “scheme-dependent,” and must not be used as sole support for a headline claim.

EVIDENCE GRADING (LEVELS 0–4) AND HEADLINE-CLAIM ENFORCEMENT.
Purpose. Separate (i) formal/internal validity, (ii) runnable protocols, and (iii) executed empirical confrontations, so that interpretive language and “headline” claims track demonstrated evidence rather than intent.

Evidence Levels (uniform across modules).
Level 0 — Formal consistency only.
• Definitions/theorems/derivations are internally consistent as written.
• No end-to-end runnable protocol is provided (or key implementation choices are underspecified).

Level 1 — Runnable protocol (reproducible in principle).
• An end-to-end protocol is specified tightly enough to run (code/configs or complete pseudo-code), including: inputs, preprocessing, estimator IDs, gates, thresholds, and required null/baseline generators.
• No executed results are claimed in this level (it is a “can be run” grade).

Level 2 — Executed on toy/synthetic (with controls).
• The Level-1 protocol is actually run on a toy model, analytic example, simulated/synthetic data, or controlled injections.
• Includes at least minimal negative controls consistent with the module (e.g., smooth-flow nulls for step claims).

Level 3 — Executed on public real data (with null tests).
• The Level-1 protocol is executed on public real datasets.
• Includes declared null tests / adversarial baselines and reports pass/fail outcomes.
• Reports enough provenance to allow third parties to rerun (data identifiers + configs + hashes or equivalent provenance checklist).

Level 4 — Independent replication.
• An independent group reproduces the Level-3 claim on the same public data (or an equivalently public dataset) using either (i) the same pipeline from the paper, or (ii) a materially independent implementation that matches the paper’s declared protocol and gates.

Headline-claim rule (hard).
• Only Level ≥3 claims may appear as headline claims.
• Level 0–2 items may appear only as: definitions, protocols, predictions, or “research program” statements, and must be explicitly labeled with their evidence level.
• If a Level ≥3 claim is later downgraded by a failed null test, loss of θ/scheme invariance, or BC-gate failure, it must be removed from headline positions and relabeled with the lower level.

Major-claim evidence register (must be kept complete).
Rule. Every major claim in this manuscript must (i) have a claim ID, (ii) be assigned an Evidence Level, and (iii) be referenced in-line where it is used. “Major claim” means any statement that is used to justify ontology-like language, geometry/causality/horizon interpretations, or any numeric prediction band.

Table EG-1 — Major claims and assigned evidence levels (v60).
Claim ID | Claim (one-line) | Evidence level | Where/what upgrades it
---|---|---|---
EG-C0 | The PCT pipeline (primitives → mediators → gates → θ-invariant reported observables) is mathematically well-defined under stated hypotheses. | 0 | Upgrade to L1 by providing a fully runnable end-to-end reference implementation for at least one complete module path (e.g., D1→D4→d_s(ℓ)→step extraction) with fixed IDs.
EG-C1 | Scope-gating (BC1–BC5) licenses or forbids interpretive language via explicit pass/fail observables and thresholds. | 0 | Upgrade to L3 by running the gate suite on at least one public dataset per declared channel and reporting both passes and failures.
EG-C2 | θ-invariant reporting is operationally achievable for the declared reported outputs (e.g., (ℓ*,Δd_s), κ, v_char) via the declared θ-aggregation protocol. | 1 | Upgrade to L3 by demonstrating θ-stability metrics + null tests on public datasets across declared θ-variants.
EG-C3 | The d_s(ℓ) estimator + step-vs-smooth + change-point protocol is runnable and yields auditable outputs with declared null tests. | 1 | Upgrade to L2 via synthetic smooth-flow/step injections; upgrade to L3 via public-data runs with null-test reporting.
EG-C4 | NO-GO registry NG1–NG5 is sufficient (as written) to prevent false-positive “geometry” narratives under the declared scheme family. | 0 | Upgrade to L2/L3 by adversarially constructing counterexamples (synthetic + then public) and showing the NG diagnostics actually fire.
EG-P1 (NC-1) | Non-calibration prediction for κ: MG-κ1 (order-unity) and locked-choice LC-κ1 band as specified. | 1 | Upgrade to L2 by injection/recovery on synthetic GW-like/CMB-like channels; upgrade to L3 by public-data confrontation with null tests.
EG-P2 (NC-2) | Non-calibration prediction for Δd_s step magnitude: MG-Δ1 and locked-choice LC-Δ1 band + refinement target. | 1 | Upgrade to L2 via synthetic smooth-vs-step benchmarks; upgrade to L3 via public-data confrontation with null tests and refinement checks.
EG-T1 | UV toy example demonstrates how scheme-dependent “UV limits” behave under explicit cutoffs/regularization. | 2 | Upgrade to L3 only if an analogous UV-regularization audit is executed and reported on public datasets.
EG-E1 | LVK/CMB/analogue channels S1–S3 are specified as test beds with executable checklists and decision thresholds. | 1 | Upgrade to L3 by actually executing each channel’s checklist on public data and reporting pass/fail + nulls.

Enforcement note (v60).
Because no Level ≥3 claims are reported in EG-1 for this version, the manuscript must not present any empirical/ontological conclusions as headline claims; all “results” language must remain conditional (“prediction,” “protocol,” “would be falsified if…”) unless and until a claim is upgraded to Level ≥3.

BC* (Scope gates; predicates, not narratives).
• BC1: manifold-likeness / distance admissibility on (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) for d_corr (and any metric/curvature proxy derived from it).
• BC2: hyperbolicity/admissibility on Ω for (A^{μν}, Z_t, Z_s, v_char) and any cone/horizon language.
• BC3–BC5: additional declared admissibility/correspondence gates used to justify IR/QFT-like interpretations.

BC1–BC5 CROSSWALK (claim-permission ↔ observable test ↔ existing community tooling).
Purpose. Make scope-gating operational: for each BC gate, specify (i) what is permitted to be said if the gate passes, (ii) what observable/audit tests the gate, and (iii) what commonly used community tools already exist to run that test.

Use rule.
• A gate is only “operationally passed” if the manuscript states: (i) the exact observable(s) used for the test, (ii) the tolerance/thresholds, (iii) the toolchain/scheme ID(s), and (iv) the negative controls.
• A statement that uses the permitted language must cite the gate state (pass/fail) and the regime (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) on the same line/paragraph.

COUPLING / INTERACTION (PLACEHOLDER; ROLE, NOT YET FIXED).
Purpose. The v60 manuscript is discriminator-first and mostly kinematic: it defines how primitive objects induce $G_2$, $L_\rho$, and diagnostics. A fully dynamical version would also specify what plays the role of “interactions,” i.e., how primitive objects update with internal index $\tau_{\mathrm{int}}$ and how updates backreact on the induced observables.

What could play the role of interactions in PCT (menu of options).
(1) Nonlinear update of the constraint population $\rho_{\mathcal K}$.
• Example form (replicator / self-avoidance style):
  $\rho_{\mathcal K}^{(\tau+1)}(u)\propto\rho_{\mathcal K}^{(\tau)}(u)\,\exp\{-\lambda\,\Phi(u;\rho_{\mathcal K}^{(\tau)})\}$
  with $\lambda\ge 0$ and some declared functional $\Phi$ (e.g., a crowding/energy functional) built from the same primitives.

(2) $\theta$-dependent projection backreaction (self-consistent $\Pi$).
• Example form: $\Pi^{(\tau+1)}(\cdot\mid u;\theta)=\mathrm{Update}_\Pi\big(\Pi^{(\tau)},\,\bar\rho^{(\tau)}(\cdot;\theta),\,\theta\big)$, so that the projection kernel responds to the projected environment field.

(3) Kernel deformation (effective coupling in $K$).
• Example form: $K^{(\tau+1)}=K^{(\tau)}+g\,\Delta K\big(K^{(\tau)},\rho_{\mathcal K}^{(\tau)},\Pi^{(\tau)}\big)$, with $g$ a coupling strength.

At least one toy interaction with a recognizable IR effect (worked placeholder).
Toy mechanism (kernel dressing that generates an IR correlation length).
• Fix a base PSD kernel $K_0$ and define a “dressed” kernel (Dyson/ladder-like) by
  $K_g(u,v) := K_0(u,v) + g\int_{\mathcal K} K_0(u,w)\,\rho_{\mathcal K}(w)\,K_0(w,v)\,d\mu_{\mathcal K}(w)$,
  with $g\ge 0$ small enough that $K_g$ remains in the declared microclass.
• Operational consequence: the induced correlator $G_2$ becomes effectively *screened* in the IR (finite correlation length), because the added positive term preferentially boosts low-lying modes of the induced inverse/generator.
• Minimal IR signature in the $L_\rho$ picture (one representative, not unique): the inverse surrogate acquires a gap-like shift $L_{\rho,g}\approx L_{\rho,0}+m_g^2 I$ for long-wavelength modes (with $m_g^2\propto g$ in the simplest phenomenology).
• Recognizable IR effect: the heat trace is suppressed for large diffusion lengths,
  $\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-\ell^2 L_{\rho,g}})\approx e^{-\ell^2 m_g^2}\,\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-\ell^2 L_{\rho,0}})$,
  yielding (i) an IR crossover at $\ell\sim 1/m_g$ and (ii) a drift toward smaller effective $d_s(\ell)$ at sufficiently large $\ell$.

Status note (scope boundary). This section is a placeholder: v60 does not claim a unique dynamical interaction law, only that plausible interaction carriers are (a) nonlinear $\rho_{\mathcal K}$ updates, (b) $\theta$-dependent $\Pi$ backreaction, and/or (c) kernel deformation, and that each produces testable IR signatures in $G_2/L_\rho$-derived diagnostics.

NUMBERED CLAIMS (STABILITY LAYER; SCOPE-GATED).
Purpose. The items below elevate the most frequently reused “claims” into numbered statements with explicit assumptions and scope gates, so later edits (style/ordering) do not change what is being asserted.

Theorem T1 (Gauge-invariant reporting requirement).
Assumptions.
• (𝒦,Σ_𝒦,μ_𝒦), (𝓜,Σ_𝓜), (Θ,Σ_Θ) are measurable spaces; ν_Θ is a probability measure on Θ.
• For each θ∈Θ, Π(·|u;θ) is a Markov kernel 𝒦×Θ→𝒫(𝓜); K is symmetric PSD on the stated microclass; ρ_𝒦 is in the integrability class required for D1.
Claim.
Any quantity Q asserted as “physical” must be accompanied by an explicit θ-invariance / θ-aggregation protocol with respect to ν_Θ (e.g., ν_Θ-mean, ν_Θ-credible interval, or worst-case over an admissible θ-family), and must be reported only through that protocol.
Scope gates.
• No BC* gate is required (this is a reporting rule, not an interpretation rule).

Symmetry emergence (internal symmetries; operational).
PCT does not postulate an internal gauge group at the primitive level; instead, internal symmetries can arise as *automorphism symmetries of the primitive correlation structure* and/or as symmetries of the projection family. The key idea is that when there exists a nontrivial group action that preserves the primitive data, the induced operators on 𝓜 inherit a commuting action and therefore decompose into representation-theoretic sectors.

Automorphism-group route (symmetry of (𝒦,K)).
Let G be a group acting measurably on 𝒦, u↦g·u, such that the primitive kernel is invariant,
  K(g·u, g·v)=K(u,v)  for all g∈G,
and (optionally) the constraint population is invariant, ρ_𝒦(g·u)=ρ_𝒦(u). Then K defines a G-equivariant integral operator on functions over 𝒦, and its spectrum decomposes into irreducible representations (irreps) of G. If, in addition, the projection family is compatible with the same symmetry (equivariance condition)
  Π(x|g·u;θ)=Π(g·x|u;θ)
for some induced action on 𝓜 (or, more weakly, the θ-aggregated outputs are invariant under the induced action), then the induced correlator G₂(·,·;θ) and any inferred inverse/generator L_ρ commute with the induced representation. Consequently, the spectral data used downstream (eigenvalues of L_ρ, heat traces, and derived d_s(ℓ)) splits into G-sectors.

Projection-group route (symmetry of the projection family).
Independently of symmetries of K, an “internal” symmetry can also appear if the projection-parameter space Θ admits a group action H acting on θ (reparameterizations, discrete flips, etc.) under which the family Π(·|u;θ) is closed and ν_Θ is invariant (or is pushed forward into an equivalent mediator). In that case, θ-aggregation enforces an H-invariant reported output, and the surviving reported structures again admit a sector decomposition labeled by irreps of H (or by its invariants).

One falsifiable consequence (degeneracy/selection rule).
If a nontrivial G-symmetry is present and the inferred L_ρ is G-equivariant on a declared (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) where the relevant gates pass, then low-lying spectral data extracted from L_ρ must exhibit *multiplet degeneracies* consistent with the dimensions of G-irreps: eigenvalues should repeat with multiplicities ≥ dim(λ) for at least one nontrivial irrep λ, and the corresponding eigenmodes should transform as that irrep. Equivalently, any “feature” in heat-trace-derived observables that is driven by a small set of modes should be reproducible after block-diagonalizing (or statistically clustering) modes into representation sectors.

Operational null test.
Repeat the same spectral/heat-trace extraction after breaking the symmetry at the primitive level by a controlled perturbation (e.g., replace K by K+εΔK where ΔK is not G-invariant, or perturb ρ_𝒦 by a non-invariant bump while keeping all estimator schemes fixed). The degeneracy/sector structure must disappear (beyond uncertainty) when ε exceeds a declared threshold, while other non-symmetry diagnostics (e.g., gross BC-gate status) may remain unchanged.

Proposition P1 (Distance-language is BC1-gated).
Assumptions.
• Fix Ω⊂𝓜 and a scale window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁].
• BC1 holds on (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) for d_corr and for any downstream metric/curvature proxy built from it.
Claim.
Within (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) and only there, it is admissible to use “distance / metric / curvature” language for d_corr-derived constructions, and any such use must explicitly cite the gate state “BC1(pass) on (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]).”
Scope gates.
• Requires BC1(pass) on (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]).

Proposition P2 (Cone / characteristic-speed language is BC2-gated).
Assumptions.
• Fix Ω⊂𝓜.
• A principal symbol exists for L_ρ on Ω and deformation functions Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄) are defined on Ω.
• BC2 holds on Ω (hyperbolicity/admissibility; in particular, the positivity/admissibility conditions for Z_t, Z_s and A^{μν} hold on the region of use).
Claim.
Within Ω and only there, it is admissible to use “hyperbolicity / cone / horizon / characteristic-speed” language, with v_char defined by v_char/c:=√(Z_s/Z_t) on the admissible subset where Z_t>0 and Z_s>0.
Scope gates.
• Requires BC2(pass) on Ω.

Proposition P3 (Spectral-dimension step outputs are window-scoped).
Assumptions.
• Fix Ω⊂𝓜 and a scale window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁].
• The heat-trace / spectral-dimension estimator protocol is run exactly as specified (see IV.A.5a / V.G.5 for ℓ* and Δd_s).
Claim.
Any reported values of ℓ* and Δd_s (and any derived headline tuple containing them) must be reported together with (i) the exact window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁], (ii) the estimator variant identifiers, and (iii) the gate state used to justify interpretation (at minimum BC1 for distance/geometry language).
Scope gates.
• Computational definition requires no BC* gate.
• Interpretation as geometric/metric signal requires BC1(pass) on (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]).

Proposition P4 (Definition and admissible use of κ).
Assumptions.
• ℓ* is extracted by the declared protocol on a stated (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]).
• A horizon proxy is defined in the same regime (e.g., r_H:=√(A_horizon/4π)) and is meaningful only where the relevant cone/horizon gate conditions are satisfied.
Claim.
The dimensionless discontinuity location κ is defined by κ:=ℓ*/r_H only when both ℓ* and r_H are simultaneously well-defined in the same declared regime; otherwise κ is undefined and must not be reported.
Scope gates.
• κ as a ratio is computationally definitional.
• Any horizon interpretation (including meaning of r_H) requires BC2(pass) on Ω (and any additional correspondence gate declared for the horizon proxy).

Table N.2 — Variable audit (role, units, and equation entry points).
Conventions.
• Role ∈ {independent (input), dependent (derived), latent (unobserved field), nuisance (gauge/threshold/auxiliary)}.
• “Units” are stated in the interpretation regime where BC1 (and when needed BC2) passes; before gating, treat them as formal/dimensionless placeholders.

Table N.2a — Parameter taxonomy (labels + enforcement rule).
Policy. Every adjustable quantity must be tagged at first introduction with exactly one label:
• (DEF) definitional choice (part of “what PCT is” for this paper; not fit-to-data)
• (CAL) correspondence calibration (a mapping chosen to match an external reference/limit)
• (THR) nuisance threshold / analysis knob (cut, window, regularization cutoff, decision threshold)
• (FREE) truly free parameter (a degree of freedom not fixed by definition or calibration)

Label | What it means | Typical examples in this paper | Reporting requirement
---|---|---|---
(DEF) | Choice that fixes the model/estimator family *before* confrontation (but is not itself a correspondence fit). | Choice of kernel family for $K$; choice of projection family for $\Pi$; choice of $\theta$-aggregation functional under $\nu_{\Theta}$; choice of inverse vs pseudoinverse convention for $L_{\rho}$; choice of monotone map from $\hat G_2$ to $d_{\mathrm{corr}}$. | Must be listed in a “Locked choices” ledger; results are conditional on these choices unless shown scheme-invariant.
(CAL) | Choice made to match a known correspondence target (units/normalization/IR limit) or an external calibration datum. | Any mapping that fixes the scale linking $\ell$ to a physical length; any GR/QFT correspondence mapping used to interpret $r_H$, $M$, $a_*$, or $r_+$; any normalization fixed to reproduce a known IR constant/limit. | Must state the correspondence target and the data/limit used; propagate calibration uncertainty into reported observables.
(THR) | Analysis tuning knob that defines admissibility, windows, or decision rules; not treated as a physical degree of freedom. | $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{out}}$; diagnostic windows $[\ell_0,\ell_1]$; regularization cutoffs in $L_{\rho}$ inversion; change-point penalties; SNR / data-quality cuts. | Must be reported next to every result it affects, with a declared sensitivity range (what was varied and what stayed invariant).
(FREE) | Parameter left genuinely unconstrained by definition/calibration in this manuscript (to be predicted, bounded, or fit in applications). | Any free hyperparameters in $Z_t(\bar\rho),Z_s(\bar\rho)$ families; any kernel/projection hyperparameters not locked by definition; any backreaction/interaction strength added in extensions. | Must appear in the parameter ledger with priors/ranges and a statement of whether it is (i) predicted, (ii) bounded, or (iii) fit in each application.

Enforcement rule.
• First use: append the tag to the symbol name (e.g., $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{out}}$ (THR)).
• Tables/figures: include the tag in the label or caption the first time that parameter appears.


Table N.3 — Scheme dependence registry (admissible-family invariances for headline quantities).
Purpose. Track which “headline” outputs are invariant under which admissible families (kernel family, Laplacian convention, and $d_{\mathrm{corr}}$ map), so results can be reused without inheriting hidden choices.

Conventions.
• “Admissible family” means a family of definitions/estimators constrained by the same stated microclass + gate conditions (BC1/BC2 as needed) and the same declared analysis window/region.
• “Invariant” below means invariant up to the declared reporting tolerance (e.g., identical decision outcome; or numerical stability within stated error bars), not pointwise identity.

Headline quantity | Default definition (this paper) | Scheme knobs that can change it | Admissible-family invariance target (what must remain unchanged to call it “scheme-invariant”) | Reporting rule
---|---|---|---|---
$\Delta d_s$ | $\Delta d_s:=d_s(\ell^*_-) - d_s(\ell^*_+)$, with $d_s(\ell)$ from the fixed heat-trace estimator | (i) Laplacian/generator convention for $L_\rho$; (ii) heat-trace estimator variant; (iii) smoothing/regularization; (iv) window $[\ell_0,\ell_1]$ | Sign of $\Delta d_s$ and the model-comparison decision (step vs smooth) must be stable across the declared estimator set within the same window and gate state | Always report: estimator IDs + smoothing/regularization ID + window $[\ell_0,\ell_1]$ + decision statistic (e.g., Bayes factor / ΔAIC) + BC1 state (if interpreted geometrically)
$\kappa$ | $\kappa:=\ell^*/r_H$ when both inputs are defined in the same regime | (i) $\ell^*$ extractor (change-point vs parametric step fit); (ii) horizon proxy choice for $r_H$; (iii) mapping from correlator sector to horizon sector; (iv) dependence of both inputs on kernel/Laplacian conventions | Existence/undefined status must be stable (i.e., either all admissible schemes define $\kappa$ or none do), and when defined the order-of-magnitude + qualitative regime classification (e.g., $\kappa\ll 1$, $\kappa\sim 1$, $\kappa\gg 1$) must be stable within stated uncertainties | Always report: the specific $\ell^*$ protocol ID + horizon proxy definition for $r_H$ + any correspondence/calibration used + BC2 state (if horizon language is invoked)
$v_{\mathrm{char}}$ | $v_{\mathrm{char}}/c:=\sqrt{Z_s/Z_t}$ extracted from the principal symbol of $L_\rho$ | (i) principal-symbol extraction convention; (ii) definition of $\delta_{\mathcal M}$ / boundary conditions used in $L_\rho\circ G_2=\delta$; (iii) choice of $d_{\mathrm{corr}}$ map / normalization affecting $G_2$-derived geometry; (iv) kernel family | Admissible region classification must be stable: the subset of $\Omega$ where BC2(pass) holds and where $Z_t,Z_s>0$ should not depend qualitatively on the admissible family; reported $v_{\mathrm{char}}$ must be stable within error bars on that subset | Always report: the $L_\rho$ convention + principal-symbol method + $d_{\mathrm{corr}}$ map/normalization choice + the exact admissibility conditions checked (BC2 criteria) and where they pass

Practical deliverables (reusable artifacts; non-engineering).
The paper is designed to be reusable even by readers who treat PCT as a null hypothesis. The deliverables below are analysis/benchmarking artifacts (code + protocols + benchmark definitions); they do not constitute device designs, engineering blueprints, or actionable “gravity control” prescriptions.

Risk \& misuse boundary.
Any discussion of “gravity control,” “horizon engineering,” or related language in this manuscript is strictly conceptual and scope-gated (BC1/BC2) as part of a falsification/constraint program: it is intended to clarify how specific discriminators would constrain theory space if observed, not to suggest that spacetime can be engineered in practice. Explicitly, this paper does *not* provide: (i) any device or experiment design for producing gravitational fields, horizons, or curvature; (ii) actionable engineering parameters (materials, geometries, tolerances, voltages/fields, power budgets, control laws, safety envelopes); (iii) claims of near-term feasibility or performance; (iv) procedures for circumventing known physical constraints or safety limits; (v) proprietary or classified methods; or (vi) step-by-step instructions that could be repurposed as an engineering recipe.

Reusable artifacts (concrete).
• Reference implementation modules for the core pipeline (construction of $G_2$, normalization $\hat G_2$, $d_{\mathrm{corr}}$, pseudoinverse/regularized $L_{\rho}$, heat-trace evaluation, and $d_s(\ell)$ estimation) with fixed identifiers for estimator variants.
• Step-vs-smooth discriminator package: a pre-registered model-comparison recipe that outputs $(\ell^*,\Delta d_s)$ with uncertainty and explicit null controls.
• Change-point / segmentation runners for time-windowed data (intended for ringdown-like windows) that enforce the paper’s “predict-before-fit” and negative-control policies.
• Public benchmark dataset manifests and preprocessing provenance checklists for the three declared channels: (S1) LVK ringdown windows, (S2) CMB running / power-spectrum summaries (Planck/ACT-like), and (S3) published analogue/graph diffusion traces.

Table MS-2 — Mediators / moderators (nuisance controls) and their effect on the pipeline.
Purpose. This table makes explicit which quantities play the role of mediators/moderators (C.1.3): they do not define the primitive content, but they *mediate* or *moderate* how primitives map into $G_2$, $d_{\mathrm{corr}}$, $L_{\rho}$ and the reported $\theta$-invariant observables. Any claim that materially depends on one of these must include a sensitivity statement (what range was varied; what conclusions were invariant).

Mediator / moderator | What it is (role) | How varying it changes $G_2$ | Effect on $d_{\mathrm{corr}}$ | Effect on $L_{\rho}$ | What must remain invariant to call a result “physical”
---|---|---|---|---|---
$\nu_{\Theta}$ (projection mediator; hyperparameter) | Probability law over $\theta\in\Theta$ used to average/compare across gauges. | Reweights the contribution of different $\theta$-slices: $G_2$-derived reported quantities shift if the $\theta$-dependence is nontrivial. | Indirect: $d_{\mathrm{corr}}$ inherits changes via $\hat G_2(x,y;\theta)$ and via how $\theta$-aggregation is performed (mean/median/robust functional). | Indirect: any $\theta$-aggregated or $\theta$-selected $G_2$ changes the inferred inverse/pseudoinverse operator (and hence heat-trace diagnostics). | (i) *Within-family stability:* qualitative claims (BC1/BC2 pass; step-vs-smooth decision; sign of $\Delta d_s$) must be stable under a declared admissible family of $\nu_{\Theta}$; (ii) reported outputs must be explicitly defined as $\theta$-invariant functionals.
$\theta$-gauge / parameterization of $\Theta$ | The choice of coordinates/representatives for the same gauge freedom; $\theta$ is nuisance by policy. | Should not change the *physical* content if treated correctly; in practice, it can induce numerical/regularization differences if the pushforward/integration is not coordinate-consistent. | Should not change any invariantly defined distance surrogate; changes signal a scheme/implementation artifact. | Same: gauge reparameterization should not change $L_{\rho}$ when the construction is defined in a coordinate-invariant way; differences indicate regularization dependence. | Invariance under reparameterizations that preserve the same underlying $\Theta$-measure class (and under the explicitly stated gauge-fixing/reporting protocol).
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{out}}$ (outward-admissibility threshold; moderator) | Threshold defining $\Theta_{\mathrm{out}}(x)$ and thus $V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}(x)$ and any boundary/horizon proxy extracted from it. | $G_2$ is typically unchanged (it is upstream), but any *derived* outward-filtered summaries can be $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{out}}$-dependent if outward filtering is applied before reporting. | Usually unchanged (unless the outward filter is used to restrict the domain/pairs over which $d_{\mathrm{corr}}$ is computed/reported). | Usually unchanged (unless $L_{\rho}$ is reconstructed only on an outward-admissible subset/weighted by outward criteria). | Qualitative existence/shape claims about $V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}(x)$, inferred $\partial B$, and any $\kappa$ that depends on an inferred $r_H$ must be stable over a stated threshold range; otherwise label them threshold-dependent.
Estimator priors / regularization choices (moderators) | Priors and regularizers in the step-vs-smooth and spectral-dimension estimation protocol (e.g., transition-width priors; smoothing penalties; trace estimators). | Does not change the definitional $G_2$, but can change estimated summaries computed from finite data/surrogates (e.g., noisy graph realizations of $G_2$ or $L_{\rho}$). | Can alter inferred $d_{\mathrm{corr}}$ if normalization/denoising is prior-driven; must be disclosed when used. | Can materially affect the reconstructed $L_{\rho}$ via inversion/pseudoinversion regularization and thus shift $d_s(\ell)$ and inferred $(\ell^*,\Delta d_s)$. | “Estimator invariants”: the step-vs-smooth decision and the existence/sign of a step must be stable across a declared prior/regularizer family (as implemented by the sensitivity modules S1–S4); otherwise report as estimator-dependent.

Overloaded terms (explicit disambiguation; used consistently below).
• “Kernel”: K(u,v) always means the primitive PSD compatibility kernel on 𝒦; it is not the emergent operator kernel of L_ρ.
• “Manifold”: 𝒦 and 𝓜 are initially only measurable spaces; “manifold” structure is asserted only after BC1 passes.

MATTER SECTOR INTERFACE (MAPPING TARGETS + MINIMAL ADDED AXIOMS).
Purpose. This section makes explicit what PCT is claiming as a *mapping target* in the IR (not a completed derivation): which PCT objects are intended to reproduce the standard free-field structures (scalar, Dirac, gauge) when the relevant gates pass. It also lists the minimum extra axioms needed so the mapping is mathematically well-posed.

Scope and gates.
• The mapping targets below are IR/correspondence statements and are therefore gated: at minimum BC1(pass) is required to speak of an emergent manifold/metric sector; BC2(pass) is required to speak of cone/hyperbolicity and characteristic speeds.
• This manuscript does not attempt SM embedding or a full matter spectrum; the goal here is to pin down *what would count as* “a scalar/Dirac/gauge field” inside the PCT pipeline.

Mapping targets (concrete objects in PCT).
(i) Scalar field target (Klein–Gordon-like sector).
Target object in the IR: a real (or complex) scalar field $\varphi$ defined as a function on $\mathcal M$ (restricted to a declared $\Omega$), with a quadratic action of the form
$S_\mathrm{sc} = \tfrac12\int_{\Omega} d\mu_{\mathcal M}\,\varphi\,(L_{\rho}+m^2)\,\varphi$,
so that the associated 2-point function is the Green’s function of $(L_{\rho}+m^2)$:
$(L_{\rho}+m^2)\,G_\mathrm{sc}(x,y)=\delta(x,y)$.
In other words, the PCT correlator inverse $L_{\rho}$ is the intended replacement for the IR scalar Laplace-type operator (up to correspondence/calibration terms).

(ii) Dirac field target (spin-1/2 sector).
Target object in the IR: a spinor field $\psi$ on $\mathcal M$ (again restricted to a declared $\Omega$) with a first-order operator $\mathcal D_{\rho}$ whose principal symbol is compatible with the cone/metric sector extracted from $L_{\rho}$ and which satisfies a Dirac-squared correspondence
$\mathcal D_{\rho}^2 \approx L_{\rho}+\text{(curvature / connection terms)}$,
so that the IR propagator is the Green’s function of $(\mathcal D_{\rho}+m)$.
Operationally, “Dirac field emerges” means: (a) one can define a local Clifford module over $\Omega$ (gamma matrices) such that $\{\gamma^\mu,\gamma^\nu\}=2g^{\mu\nu}$ for the $g^{\mu\nu}$ implied by the $L_{\rho}$ principal symbol, and (b) the resulting $\mathcal D_{\rho}$ reproduces the observed dispersion / characteristic speeds in the admissible regime.

(iii) Gauge field target (spin-1 sector).
Target object in the IR: a principal $G$-bundle (or vector bundle in a representation) over $\mathcal M$ with a connection $A_\mu$ and curvature $F_{\mu\nu}$, such that a gauge-covariant Laplace-type operator $\Delta_A$ exists and controls gauge-boson propagation/response:
$\Delta_A := (\nabla_\mu + A_\mu)(\nabla^\mu + A^\mu)+\cdots$,
with $\nabla$ compatible with the emergent metric sector. In PCT terms, the intended “handle” for a gauge connection is the residual internal redundancy after θ-aggregation and/or an automorphism symmetry of the primitive data $(\mathcal K,K,\rho_{\mathcal K},\Pi)$ that acts fiberwise on an attached internal space. Gauge emergence is operationally defined by the existence of (a) a group $G$ acting as an internal symmetry of the induced correlators/diagnostics, and (b) a well-defined notion of parallel transport/holonomy whose curvature produces observable selection rules or degeneracy patterns.

Minimal added axioms needed for a well-posed mapping.
Axiom MS1 (IR manifold + measure structure).
Assume that on a declared regime (\Omega,[\ell_0,\ell_1]) with BC1(pass), the label space admits an atlas and measure $d\mu_{\mathcal M}$ compatible with the distance/proximity structure induced by $d_{\mathrm{corr}}$ (up to a declared correspondence convention).

Axiom MS2 (Second-order locality / Laplace type).
Assume that in the IR window, the operator $L_{\rho}$ admits an approximation by a (possibly variable-coefficient) Laplace-type differential operator on $\Omega$ with a well-defined principal symbol. This is the minimal condition required to interpret $L_{\rho}$ as an IR kinetic operator for scalar modes.

Axiom MS3 (Spin structure + Clifford module).
Assume that on the same admissible regime, $\Omega$ supports a spin structure (or at minimum a local Clifford module) so one can define gamma matrices and a first-order operator $\mathcal D_{\rho}$ with $\mathcal D_{\rho}^2$ matching $L_{\rho}$ up to controlled lower-order terms. This is the minimal extra structure needed to make the Dirac mapping meaningful.

Axiom MS4 (Internal symmetry group and associated bundle).
Assume the existence of a compact Lie group $G$ and a representation space $V$ such that the primitive construction admits a $G$-action that leaves the reportable θ-invariant outputs unchanged (a true redundancy/symmetry, not just a reparameterization). This promotes “internal labels” to fibers and makes a gauge principle definable.

Axiom MS5 (Connection as transport rule).
Assume a prescription for parallel transport on the associated bundle over $\Omega$ (equivalently, a connection 1-form $A$) defined in terms of PCT data (e.g., as an emergent response of the correlator phase/structure under infinitesimal changes in projection/automorphism parameters). This is the minimal ingredient required to define curvature $F$ and hence a gauge-field kinetic sector.

Axiom MS6 (Coupling rule / minimal coupling statement).
Assume a declared coupling principle: replace $\nabla\to\nabla+A$ in the kinetic operators (or its discrete/graph analogue before taking the IR limit), and specify how matter fields (scalar/spinor) transform under $G$. Without this, “gauge field” is underdetermined because a connection with no transformation/coupling rule has no physical content.

Deliverable boundary (what this paper does vs does not do).
• This paper defines $L_{\rho}$ and its diagnostics and uses them for discriminator-first tests. It does not construct $\mathcal D_{\rho}$, prove MS3, or build a nonabelian $G$-connection with executed phenomenology; those are next-paper deliverables.
• The operational criterion for progress is: exhibit an explicit $\mathcal D_{\rho}$ and a concrete $G$-connection construction, then show at least one falsifiable consequence (dispersion relation, degeneracy/selection rule, or null-testable polarization pattern) that survives θ-aggregation and robustness audits.

Minimal worked example (emergent Klein–Gordon/Dirac-like propagators from $L_{\rho}$).
Purpose. Provide the smallest concrete bridge from the formal inverse-generator construction to standard free-field propagators, while explicitly separating what is *derived by definition* from what is *assumed/approximated* as an IR correspondence.

Setup and explicit assumptions.
• Regime: fix a declared region $\Omega\subset\mathcal M$ and an IR window $[\ell_0,\ell_1]$ where BC1(pass) holds, so manifold/metric language is admissible on $\Omega$.
• Operator existence: use the paper’s definition of $L_{\rho}$ as an inverse (or regularized inverse) of the induced correlator: $L_{\rho}\circ G_2=\delta$ on the stated domain.
• IR locality assumption (MS2): on $\Omega$ and within the IR window, assume $L_{\rho}$ is well-approximated by a Laplace-type differential operator with principal symbol $g^{\mu\nu}$:
  $L_{\rho}\;\approx\;-\frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}}\,\partial_\mu\!\big(\sqrt{|g|}\,g^{\mu\nu}\,\partial_\nu\big)\;+\;V(x)$,
  where $V(x)$ is a (possibly small) lower-order potential/curvature correction.
• (Optional for Dirac) Spin structure assumption (MS3): on the same regime, assume a local Clifford module exists so one can define $\gamma^\mu(x)$ satisfying $\{\gamma^\mu,\gamma^\nu\}=2g^{\mu\nu}$ and a first-order operator $\mathcal D_{\rho}$ whose square matches $L_{\rho}$ up to lower-order terms.

Scalar (Klein–Gordon-like) propagator.
What is derived (definition-level).
• Given any declared mass parameter $m$ (a correspondence/calibration parameter unless derived elsewhere), define the scalar Green’s function by
  $(L_{\rho}+m^2)\,G_{\mathrm{sc}}(x,y)=\delta(x,y)$.
This is not an extra assumption: it is the standard way to read a quadratic action $\tfrac12\varphi(L_{\rho}+m^2)\varphi$ as defining a free 2-point function.

What is approximated (IR/flat-patch correspondence).
• In a sufficiently small patch of $\Omega$ where $g^{\mu\nu}\approx\eta^{\mu\nu}$ and $V(x)$ is negligible (or slowly varying), Fourier modes approximately diagonalize the operator and one obtains the familiar momentum-space form
  $G_{\mathrm{sc}}(p)\;\approx\;\frac{1}{p^2+m^2}$,
  with the understanding that $p^2$ is computed using the emergent principal symbol (and signature conventions fixed by the BC2-admissible cone sector when invoked).

Spin-1/2 (Dirac-like) propagator.
What is derived (definition-level).
• If an explicit first-order $\mathcal D_{\rho}$ is provided, define the spinor Green’s function by
  $(\mathcal D_{\rho}+m)\,S(x,y)=\delta(x,y)$.

What is approximated (Dirac-squared correspondence + flat-patch limit).
• Under MS3, assume a Dirac-squared correspondence of the form
  $\mathcal D_{\rho}^2\;\approx\;L_{\rho}+\text{(connection/curvature lower-order terms)}$.
• In a locally flat patch where those lower-order terms are negligible and $\mathcal D_{\rho}\approx i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu$, the standard propagator form is recovered:
  $S(p)\;\approx\;\frac{i\gamma\!\cdot\! p+m}{p^2+m^2}$.

Clear boundary (what this example does and does not claim).
• Derived here: how the *definition* of $L_{\rho}$ (as an inverse of $G_2$) induces canonical free-field Green’s functions once one declares the kinetic operator $(L_{\rho}+m^2)$ or $(\mathcal D_{\rho}+m)$.
• Approximated here: the identification of $L_{\rho}$ with a local Laplace-type operator and the reduction to the usual $(p^2+m^2)^{-1}$ / $(i\gamma\cdot p+m)/(p^2+m^2)$ forms. These require MS2/MS3 and are correspondence statements, not consequences of the primitive pushforward alone.

WORKED IR CORRESPONDENCE DEMONSTRATION (LOCKED CHANNEL: WEAK-FIELD ON $\Omega_{\rm ext}$).
Purpose. Replace “IR target” language with a single explicit derivation chain—starting from the primitives—showing how (i) a Laplace-type local operator emerges approximately (BC3), and (ii) the proxy relations for $g_{tt}$, $g_{rr}$ and $v_{\rm char}$ arise from the principal symbol, including explicit remainder/error terms and a falsifiable inequality that can fail.

Scope and locks (what is held fixed in this worked channel).
• Region: choose a declared exterior patch $\Omega_{\rm ext}\subset\Omega$ where the manifold/metric gate BC1 passes and the cone/admissibility gate BC2 passes.
• Window: fix an IR window $[\ell_0,\ell_1]$ such that the heat-trace probes are dominated by scales $\ell\gg \ell_{\rm micro}$ (the micro/nonlocal scale of the chosen kernel family).
• Locked primitive microclass for this demo: the manuscript’s default (kernel family + projection family + $\nu_\Theta$) as listed in PL1–PL8.

Step 0 (primitive pushforward definition; no correspondence assumption yet).
By D1 (primitives → induced correlator), the induced two-point correlator on $\mathcal M$ is
  $G_2(x,y;\theta)=\iint_{\mathcal K\times\mathcal K} \Pi(x\mid u;\theta)\,K(u,v)\,\Pi(y\mid v;\theta)\,\rho_{\mathcal K}(u)\,\rho_{\mathcal K}(v)\,d\mu_{\mathcal K}(u)\,d\mu_{\mathcal K}(v)$,
and the (scheme-declared) inverse-generator is defined by D4 as the operator $L_{\rho}$ satisfying, on its declared domain,
  $(L_{\rho}\circ G_2)(x,y;\theta)=\delta(x,y)$
(or the corresponding pseudoinverse/regularized relation when OP-UV2 requires it).

Step 1 (IR localization hypothesis stated as an explicit bound; BC3 gate content).
BC3 (IR-locality) is enforced here as an *operational approximation* with a remainder term: there must exist a Laplace-type operator $L_{\rm IR}$ on $\Omega_{\rm ext}$ and a remainder operator $R_{\rm IR}$ such that, for all test functions $f$ supported in $\Omega_{\rm ext}$,
  $L_{\rho} f = L_{\rm IR} f + R_{\rm IR} f,$
with a declared smallness bound on the quadratic form in the IR regime
  $|\langle f, R_{\rm IR} f\rangle| \le \varepsilon_{\rm IR}\,\langle f, (I+L_{\rm IR}) f\rangle\quad\text{for all } f\in\mathcal D_{\rm test}(\Omega_{\rm ext}).$
Here $\varepsilon_{\rm IR}$ is a reportable (THR) tolerance and $\mathcal D_{\rm test}$ is a declared dense test domain (e.g., smooth compactly supported functions in the coordinate chart used on $\Omega_{\rm ext}$).

Step 2 (choose the Laplace-type ansatz and expose the correspondence knobs).
In this worked channel, take the IR ansatz (MS2) in explicit Laplace-type form
  $L_{\rm IR} := -\frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}}\,\partial_\mu\!\big(\sqrt{|g|}\,g^{\mu\nu}\,\partial_\nu\big) + V(x)$,
where $V(x)$ is a lower-order term. To separate “physics” from “calibration,” we parameterize the principal part on $\Omega_{\rm ext}$ by two deformation functions (already used elsewhere in the cone sector):
  $g^{tt}(x) = -\frac{1}{Z_t(x)}\,[1+\delta_t(x)],\qquad g^{rr}(x) = \frac{1}{Z_s(x)}\,[1+\delta_r(x)],$
with error fields $\delta_t,\delta_r$ absorbing (i) chart/conformal choices, and (ii) the fact that only the principal symbol is constrained by the operator data. The correspondence content is then: in the weak-field exterior regime, $Z_t,Z_s$ are slowly varying and close to unity, while $\delta_t,\delta_r$ are bounded by the IR-remainder tolerance.

Step 3 (read off the principal symbol from $L_{\rho}$ and connect to $Z_t,Z_s$).
Let $A^{\mu\nu}(x)$ denote the principal symbol tensor extracted from $L_{\rho}$ on $\Omega_{\rm ext}$ (as in Table N.1). In the IR-locality regime, the principal symbols of $L_{\rho}$ and $L_{\rm IR}$ agree up to the same remainder tolerance:
  $A^{\mu\nu}(x) = g^{\mu\nu}(x) + \Delta A^{\mu\nu}(x),\qquad \|\Delta A\|_{\Omega_{\rm ext}}\le c_A\,\varepsilon_{\rm IR},$
with $c_A$ a declared constant depending on the symbol-extraction convention.

On a static, approximately spherically symmetric exterior patch (the “weak-field on $\Omega_{\rm ext}$” lock), the symbol may be diagonalized so that the dominant components satisfy
  $A^{tt}(x)\approx -\frac{1}{Z_t(x)},\qquad A^{rr}(x)\approx \frac{1}{Z_s(x)}$,
with componentwise errors controlled by $\Delta A^{\mu\nu}$.

Step 4 (proxy relations for $g_{tt}, g_{rr}$ with error terms and regime of validity).
Inverting the above relations gives the stated metric proxies (up to the unavoidable conformal/coordinate conventions made explicit through $\delta_t,\delta_r$):
  $g_{tt}(x) \approx -Z_t(x)\,[1+\mathcal O(\varepsilon_{\rm IR})],\qquad g_{rr}(x) \approx Z_s(x)\,[1+\mathcal O(\varepsilon_{\rm IR})],\quad x\in\Omega_{\rm ext}$
with the regime of validity restricted to:
  (i) BC1(pass), BC2(pass), BC3(pass) on $(\Omega_{\rm ext},[\ell_0,\ell_1])$;
  (ii) slow-variation: $\ell_1\,\|\nabla\log Z_{t,s}\|_{\Omega_{\rm ext}}\ll 1$ (so the probe scale does not resolve variations that would invalidate a local symbol interpretation);
  (iii) remainder bound: $\varepsilon_{\rm IR}$ below the manuscript’s declared threshold for “weak-field correspondence.”

Step 5 (proxy relation for characteristic speed $v_{\rm char}$ including errors).
When BC2 passes, the characteristic speed proxy is defined from the cone sector by
  $\frac{v_{\rm char}(x)}{c}=\sqrt{\frac{Z_s(x)}{Z_t(x)}}$.
In this worked IR channel, the principal-symbol relation implies that the same quantity can be read directly from $A^{\mu\nu}$ up to the BC3 remainder:
  $\frac{v_{\rm char}(x)}{c}=\sqrt{\frac{A^{rr}(x)}{-A^{tt}(x)}}\,[1+\mathcal O(\varepsilon_{\rm IR})],\qquad x\in\Omega_{\rm ext}.$

Step 6 (at least one falsifiable inequality bound that can fail).
Weak-field exterior correspondence requires that $v_{\rm char}$ be approximately luminal (in the chosen calibration units) and that the operator be approximately Laplace-type. A single falsifiable bound that must hold in this worked channel is:

(IR-luminality bound; falsifier).
There exists a declared tolerance $\varepsilon_v$ (THR) such that
  $\sup_{x\in\Omega_{\rm ext}}\Big|\frac{v_{\rm char}(x)}{c}-1\Big|\;\le\;\varepsilon_v.$
Equivalently (to first order),
  $\sup_{x\in\Omega_{\rm ext}}\Big|\frac{Z_s(x)}{Z_t(x)}-1\Big|\;\le\;2\varepsilon_v+\mathcal O(\varepsilon_v^2)+\mathcal O(\varepsilon_{\rm IR}).$
If either inequality fails under θ-invariant reporting (R1) while BC1/BC2 are claimed to pass on the same regime, then the “weak-field IR correspondence on $\Omega_{\rm ext}$” channel is falsified for that dataset/instantiation.

Interpretation note (what is and is not “derived”).
• Derived from primitives + definitions: the exact induced correlator $G_2$ (D1) and the formal inverse relation defining $L_{\rho}$ (D4).
• Additional correspondence content (and therefore falsifiable): the existence of a Laplace-type $L_{\rm IR}$ with a small remainder $R_{\rm IR}$ on $\Omega_{\rm ext}$ (BC3), and the weak-field smallness/slow-variation bounds that justify reading metric/velocity proxies from the principal symbol.

PARAMETER LEDGER (FREE QUANTITIES AND STATUS TAGS).
Purpose. Make every “degree of freedom” explicit and classify it so the reader can see what is fixed, conventional, calibrated, or genuinely free. Each result table/figure should cite the relevant ledger IDs.

Tag meanings.
• fixed by definition: required by the construction once the primitive objects are specified.
• chosen by convention: analysis/implementation choice; should be accompanied by sensitivity checks when conclusions depend on it.
• calibrated: set by fitting to data or by matching a benchmark; must be explicitly labeled as calibration (not a prediction).
• genuinely free: a parameter of the model family not fixed by definition, convention, or calibration; must carry an explicit prior/range when used.

PHYSICAL ASSUMPTIONS VS MATHEMATICAL CONVENIENCES (REMOVABILITY AUDIT).
This section separates (i) assumptions that carry physical content for PCT from (ii) choices made mainly for mathematical/implementation convenience. “Removable” means the core mechanism and claimed observables can be defined without the convenience, possibly with extra machinery (regularization, discrete analogs, or alternative monotone maps).

Physical assumptions (content).
• Primitive relational structure exists: a compatibility/correlation kernel K(u,v) and a nonnegative population/weight ρ_𝒦(u) on a pregeometric domain 𝒦.
• Emergent labels are induced by a projection mechanism Π(·|u;θ) with θ treated as a gauge/nuisance parameter; only θ-invariant reporting is taken as physical.
• “Geometry/causality language” is not assumed; it is licensed only conditionally by explicit gates (BC1–BC5) on a stated regime (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]).

Mathematical conveniences (with removability).
Convenience | Why it is used here | Removable?
---|---|---
Measurable-space framing for 𝒦, 𝓜, Θ | Minimal generality for integrals/sums and pushforwards | Partially: some formalism (measure/σ-algebra or counting measure) is needed, but it need not be a continuum setting.
Assuming K is PSD (microclass M1) | Ensures a well-behaved correlation-like structure and simplifies inversion/regularization | Removable for some constructions: one can work with indefinite kernels, but then positivity/interpretability and some diagnostics must be redefined or restricted.
Normalization Ĝ₂:=|G₂|/√(G₂(x,x)G₂(y,y)) | Makes the distance surrogate scale-free and comparable across amplitudes | Yes: any scale-fixing convention (or an explicit amplitude parameter) can replace it.
Distance map d_corr:=−log Ĝ₂ | Converts multiplicative decay into additive distances and fixes monotonicity | Yes: any strictly decreasing monotone map f(Ĝ₂) with stated properties can be used; conclusions must be reported as map-invariant where claimed.
Taking ν_Θ as a probability measure (ν_Θ(Θ)=1) | Convenient normalization for θ-averaging and reporting | Yes: can use σ-finite weights and then renormalize observables locally; probability normalization is bookkeeping.
Existence of an inverse-generator L_ρ via L_ρ∘G₂=δ | Provides an operator for diffusion/heat-trace diagnostics | Yes, with caveats: can replace by a pseudoinverse, regularized inverse, or work directly with G₂ without introducing L_ρ.
Principal symbol A^{μν}(x) / PDE language | Lets one use hyperbolicity/characteristics as a cone proxy (BC2) | Yes: on discrete/graph/integro-operator realizations, replace by discrete cones/propagation bounds or symbol-free admissibility criteria.
Heat-trace / spectral dimension definition via Tr(e^{−ℓ²L_ρ}) | Standard diagnostic and scale-dependent dimension estimator | Mostly: the diagnostic can be estimated stochastically or replaced by walk/return-probability definitions when the trace is ill-defined; some regularization is still required.
Fixed thresholds (e.g., ε_out) and chosen scale windows [ℓ₀,ℓ₁] | Makes “outward/admissible” and “IR window” operational | Yes: thresholds/windows are analysis choices; the paper must report sensitivity to reasonable alternatives when a claim depends on them.
Smooth-manifold regularity when invoking BC1/BC2 | Allows differential-geometric language and derivatives | Yes: one can stay at the level of metric-measure spaces, graphs, or coarse-grained structures; smoothness is only needed for the strongest GR-style statements.

CORE VS PROVISIONAL (WHAT SHOULD SURVIVE VARIANTS?)  [longevity vs novelty]
Purpose. Make explicit which parts of PCT are intended as durable “core” commitments
versus which are provisional instantiations that may change as variants are explored.

CORE (expected to survive reasonable variant changes)
• Gating philosophy: strong geometric/causal language is licensed only after explicit
  pass/fail gates (BC1–BC5) on a stated regime (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]).
• θ-as-gauge and θ-invariant reporting: θ is treated as nuisance; only θ-invariant
  outputs/summary statistics are reported as physical.
• Provenance + locked-choice discipline: every figure/table/result is tied to a declared
  analysis region Ω, scale window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁], and recorded analysis choices (thresholds,
  regularization, estimator family) so results are replicable and auditable.
• Falsifier-first design: null tests and “gate fails” outcomes are first-class outputs,
  not afterthoughts; discriminator absence is itself a reportable result.
• Robustness by controlled swaps: estimator-swap / refinement / nuisance-sweep is part
  of the interpretation protocol whenever a claim depends on a choice.

PROVISIONAL (likely to change across variants / subject to sensitivity studies)
• Specific functional forms / ansätze (examples): a particular Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄) family;
  any fixed monotonicity parametrization; any chosen ρ̄ construction details.
• Specific threshold values and windows: any numeric ε_out choice; any particular
  default [ℓ₀,ℓ₁] window; any “typical” κ prior range used in an application module.
• Specific operator/distance conventions: d_corr:=−log Ĝ₂ vs alternative monotone maps;
  the choice of inverse vs pseudoinverse vs regularized inverse for L_ρ.
• Specific observational mappings: e.g., a particular ringdown change-point template,
  likelihood choices, or waveform/systematics treatment in an application pipeline.

Reading rule. When a conclusion depends on a PROVISIONAL item, it must be reported as
conditional on that choice and accompanied by a stated sensitivity/robustness check.

DEPENDENCY DAG (PRIMITIVES → MEDIATORS → GATES → OBSERVABLES).
Purpose. Make the direction of dependence explicit so the reader can distinguish (i) definitions, (ii) empirical assumptions (modeling commitments), and (iii) testable implications.

Edge labels.
[D] definitional: follows by construction once upstream objects are specified.
[A] empirical assumption: a modeling restriction/ansatz/regularity commitment not forced by the formalism.
[T] testable implication: a downstream, reportable consequence that can be confronted with data (or with a null test) once the gates/estimation protocol are fixed.

Nodes (layered).
Primitives P:
  P1: 𝒦, ρ_𝒦(u)
  P2: K(u,v) (and microclass conditions such as PSD if adopted)
  P3: Π(·|u;θ), θ∈Θ
  P4: ν_Θ (≡Λ)
  P5: analysis choices: Ω, [ℓ₀,ℓ₁], regularization choices for inverses/traces

Mediators M (constructed on 𝓜):
  M1: G₂(x,y;θ)
  M2: Ĝ₂(x,y;θ)
  M3: d_corr(x,y;θ)
  M4: L_ρ (inverse / pseudoinverse / regularized generator)
  M5: A^{μν}(x) (or a symbol-free propagation proxy on non-smooth realizations)
  M6: ρ̄(x;θ)

Reported observables O (θ-invariant summaries):

  O4: Θ_out(x), V_{Π,out}(x), inferred boundary ∂B (when used)

DAG (with labeled edges).
Primitives → mediators (construction edges):
  (P1,P2,P3) → M1  [D]  (pushforward definition of G₂)
  M1 → M2          [D]  (normalization)
  M2 → M3          [D]  (distance map)
  M1 → M4          [A]  (choice that an inverse-like L_ρ is introduced; includes regularization scheme)
  M4 → M5          [A]  (choice of principal-symbol / cone proxy extraction; smoothness assumptions if used)
  (P1,P3) → M6     [D]  (projected field construction once specified)
  M6 → M7          [A]  (ansatz family for Z_t(·), Z_s(·) including monotonicity/positivity commitments)

Mediators → gates (admissibility edges):
  M3 → G1          [T]  (BC1 is a testable pass/fail on the induced distance/geometry surrogate)
  M5,M7 → G2       [T]  (BC2 is a testable pass/fail on the propagation/cone proxy)
  (P2,P3,P4,M1) → G3 [T] (BC3–BC5 are testable pass/fail admissibility checks for the kernel/projection/IR window)

Gates/mediators → observables (reporting edges):
  M4 → O1          [D]  (given L_ρ, the heat-trace protocol defines d_s(ℓ), then (ℓ*,Δd_s))
  (O1, r_H) → O2   [D]  (definition of κ once r_H is available)
  (M7, G2) → O3    [D]  (definition of v_char in admissible regimes)
  (P3,P4,ε_out) → O4 [A→D] (ε_out is an analysis choice [A]; then Θ_out,V_{Π,out} are definitional [D])

Reading rule.
• If an arrow is marked [A], any downstream “directional” language (e.g., “increasing ρ̄ slows propagation”) is conditional on that assumption family and must be stated as such.
• If an arrow is marked [T], the output is a falsifiable gate/outcome: a null test exists (“gate fails” or the discriminator is absent) and must be reported under the fixed protocol.

DIRECTIONAL STATEMENTS → EQUATIONS / INEQUALITIES (MONOTONICITY CONVENTION).
This manuscript avoids informal “X increases Y” claims unless they can be expressed as a sign condition. When a directional statement is used, it is to be read as one of the following explicit forms (and is only asserted on the stated region Ω and scale window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁]).

(DS1) Correlation-strength vs correlation-distance.
By definition,
d_corr(x,y;\theta) := -\log \hat G_2(x,y;\theta), \quad \hat G_2 \in (0,1].
Therefore the direction is fixed (no sign ambiguity):
\frac{\partial d_\mathrm{corr}}{\partial \hat G_2} = -\frac{1}{\hat G_2} < 0.
Equivalently, for fixed (x,y,\theta), if \hat G_2 increases then d_corr decreases (and vice versa).

(DS2) Born-volume weights vs outcome probability.
For W(m) > 0 and P(m) := W(m)/\sum_{m'} W(m'), we have (holding all other W(m'\neq m) fixed):
\frac{\partial P(m)}{\partial W(m)} = \frac{\sum_{m'\neq m} W(m')}{\big(\sum_{m'} W(m')\big)^2} > 0.
So “more preimage weight makes an outcome more likely” is an inequality, not an informal trend.

(DS3) Cone deformation and characteristic speed.
In admissible regimes (BC2) with Z_t(\bar\rho)>0 and Z_s(\bar\rho)>0 on Ω,
\frac{v_\mathrm{char}}{c} = \sqrt{\frac{Z_s}{Z_t}}.
Hence (pointwise on Ω):
\frac{\partial v_\mathrm{char}}{\partial Z_s} > 0, \qquad \frac{\partial v_\mathrm{char}}{\partial Z_t} < 0.
If a narrative claim asserts “\bar\rho slows propagation” (or “speeds it up”), it must specify the monotonicity assumptions being imposed on that instantiation, e.g.
\frac{d}{d\bar\rho}\Big(\frac{Z_s(\bar\rho)}{Z_t(\bar\rho)}\Big) \le 0 \quad (\text{slowing}),
\qquad
\frac{d}{d\bar\rho}\Big(\frac{Z_s(\bar\rho)}{Z_t(\bar\rho)}\Big) \ge 0 \quad (\text{speeding}).
A “direction flip” is permitted only where the derivative changes sign; i.e., at points x where
\frac{d}{d\bar\rho}\big(Z_s/Z_t\big)\big|_{\bar\rho=\bar\rho(x;\theta)} = 0
or where the derivative is discontinuous/undefined (these loci must be stated when invoking a flip).

(DS4) Horizon/outward-admissibility trends.
When the outward-compatible projection volume V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}(x) is used as an “escape/amplitude” proxy, any statement of the form “steeper boundary → smaller escape” must be stated as a monotonicity condition on the chosen steepness functional S(x) (e.g., S(x)=\|\nabla \bar\rho(x)\|):
\frac{\partial V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}(x)}{\partial S(x)} \le 0 \quad \text{(escape suppression)}.
A direction flip is allowed only if \partial V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}/\partial S changes sign over Ω, and the flip-region must be explicitly identified.

FUNCTIONAL-FORM POLICY (LINEARITY/NONLINEARITY) AND FORM-INVARIANCE CHECKS.
PCT introduces several explicit functional-form choices. To prevent “hidden modeling” from being mistaken for mechanism, we consolidate the key choices here and enforce a uniform invariance rule.

(FF0) Consolidated functional choices (defaults, admissible alternatives, and invariants).
In every case below, the “default” is the form actually used to generate the reported headline discriminators (unless a subsection explicitly overrides it). Any qualitative conclusion is treated as supported only if it is invariant across the listed admissible alternatives, on the stated region Ω and scale window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁].

Table FF-1 — Key functional choices (single-point reference).
Module | Default form (used unless overridden) | Admissible alternatives (sensitivity family) | Conclusions required to be invariant (otherwise re-scope/withdraw)
---|---|---|---
F1) Distance functional (correlator → distance surrogate) | d_corr(x,y;\theta) := −log \hat G_2(x,y;\theta) | Any monotone map f:(0,1]→[0,∞) that preserves ordering; explicitly audited family: d_corr^{(p)} := (\hat G_2^{−p}−1)/p (p>0); and a local linear proxy d_corr^{(lin)} := 1−\hat G_2 (only where it remains metric-admissible / BC1-relevant). | (i) BC1 pass/fail status; (ii) relative ordering of inferred distances (up to monotone reparametrization); (iii) existence/non-existence of any claimed finite-ℓ discontinuity in d_s(ℓ) under the *same* d_s estimator and the same window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁].
F2) Z_t/Z_s ansatz families (cone deformation; propagation proxy) | Z_t(\bar\rho), Z_s(\bar\rho) as specified in the subsection where BC2 is evaluated / used. | Constraint-preserving families that enforce Z_t>0, Z_s>0 on Ω and preserve the stated monotonicity convention; audited family includes: (i) linear response Z_{t,s}=1+a_{t,s}\bar\rho (restricted to Z_{t,s}>0), (ii) exponential positivity Z_{t,s}=\exp(a_{t,s}\bar\rho), (iii) saturating response Z_{t,s}=1+\tanh(a_{t,s}\bar\rho), (iv) quadratic response Z_{t,s}=1+a_{t,s}\bar\rho+b_{t,s}\bar\rho^2 (restricted to Z_{t,s}>0). | (i) Sign of d(Z_s/Z_t)/d\bar\rho on Ω (including explicit identification of any “flip set” where the sign changes or is undefined); (ii) any reported bounds on v_char/c=√(Z_s/Z_t) within stated uncertainty; (iii) whether BC2 passes/fails under the same admissibility tests.
F3) Step-vs-smooth baseline models (for finite-ℓ discontinuity claims) | The step model and smooth-flow model defined in the stated step-detection protocol. | Smooth-flow alternatives: swap parametrizations with comparable effective degrees of freedom (e.g., low-order polynomial in logℓ vs rational in logℓ). Step alternatives: (i) sharp step and (ii) smoothed step (e.g., logistic/tanh transition) under a matched effective transition-width prior. | (i) Model-selection outcome (“step” vs “smooth”) under the same decision rule (ΔAIC threshold or Bayes factor threshold as declared); (ii) sign of Δd_s; (iii) inferred ℓ* stability (hence κ stability when κ is reported) within uncertainty.

(FF1) Minimal-order / constraint-respecting principle.
Choose the lowest-complexity functional form consistent with the required constraints (positivity, boundedness, correct limits, and stated monotonicity) on the stated regime (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]). “Linear” is preferred as a local first-order expansion around a reference regime; “nonlinear” is used only when linearity violates a constraint or when a specific asymptotic/threshold behavior is part of the claimed mechanism.

(FF2) Separate “physics constraints” from “parametrization convenience.”
When a nonlinear map is adopted primarily for convenience (e.g., enforcing positivity by exponentiation), explicitly state the equivalent constraint being enforced, and treat alternative constraint-enforcing parametrizations as equivalent candidates.

(FF3) Reporting requirement (form-invariance audit).
Whenever a qualitative claim depends on a functional-form choice in Table FF-1, include a short audit table (module; default form; admissible alternatives; which qualitative conclusions were invariant; which were not). Non-invariant qualitative conclusions must be explicitly re-scoped (e.g., “scheme-dependent”) or withdrawn.

Abstract: 
 
[EM1] Projective Correlation Theory (PCT) is specified here as a discriminator-first, regime-gated reconstruction pipeline from explicit pregeometric primitives (𝒦, K, Π, ν_Θ≡Λ, ρ_𝒦) to θ-invariant, data-facing observables on 𝓜, with boundary-condition gates (BC1–BC5) that license (or forbid) GR/QFT interpretation on a stated (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]).
[EM2] The manuscript provides fully specified definitions and reproducible protocols for constructing G₂, d_corr, and a regulated inverse-like generator L_ρ, and for computing spectral-dimension curves d_s(ℓ) and extracting (ℓ*, Δd_s) via a fixed step-vs-smooth decision rule.
[EM3] When (and only when) BC2(pass) holds on Ω and a horizon proxy r_H is defined in the same gated regime, the dimensionless ratio κ≡ℓ*/r_H is a permitted reported discriminator; otherwise any κ/horizon claim is explicitly forbidden.
[EM4] All headline outputs are required to be θ-invariant, scheme-audited, and (when “flow/UV/IR” language is used) tied to an explicit RG invariance target (T1/T2/T3) that is checked and reported.
[EM8] Evidence status in v60 is “Done now” for formal definitions/gates/protocols and “Runnable now” for dataset confrontations; no executed end-to-end real-data confirmation is claimed.

EXECUTIVE MAP OF CLAIMS → GATES → TESTS → STATUS (v55; one-page referee map)

How to read this map.
• “Headline claim” means a claim that may appear as an assertive statement in the Abstract/Introduction/Results summaries.
• Each headline claim is permitted only if its required gates and invariance targets are satisfied *on the stated (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) and under the declared scheme family*.
• Forbidden-claim rule (enforced): if a claim’s gate(s) or test(s) are not satisfied (or not reported), the manuscript must not assert that claim anywhere except as a conditional “if/then” statement that explicitly cites this table row.

Table EM-1 — Executive map (Claims → Gates → Tests → Status).
Row | Headline claim (exact) | Required BC gates | Required invariance targets | Minimal test(s) that must be reported | Status in v54

EM3 | The manuscript provides a fixed, reusable protocol for d_s(ℓ) and a step-vs-smooth decision that extracts (ℓ*,Δd_s) with required null tests/robustness audits. | None for computing d_s(ℓ) as a regulated diagnostic; BC1 required to *interpret* d_s(ℓ) as geometry | θ-invariance; scheme-audit on estimator/window/regularization | RC6.1 (step-vs-smooth), estimator swap, window/smoothing bracket, negative controls | Done now (protocol)
EM4 | For any stated dataset/operator surrogate L, the claim “a finite-scale step exists” is permitted only if the fixed step-vs-smooth test prefers “step” and survives declared null controls and θ/scheme audits on (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]). | BC1 only if the step is interpreted as geometric; otherwise none | θ-invariance; scheme-invariance of the step decision within declared family | Step-vs-smooth model comparison + calibrated nulls + θ-stability metric | Runnable now

Narrative summary (what is “in” vs “out” as a claim in v55).
• “Done now” claims are about formal specification (definitions, gates, invariance targets, protocols, and the forbid/permit logic) and therefore do not depend on any dataset.
• “Runnable now” claims are strictly procedural: given a dataset/operator surrogate, the manuscript specifies what to run and what would count as pass/fail; these are not confirmations.
• Any sentence that asserts a physical conclusion (geometry/causality/horizon/IR correspondence) without simultaneously satisfying EM2 (scope gate) and the row’s required tests is, by construction, out of scope and must be rewritten as a conditional.

MINIMUM PUBLISHABLE CLAIM SET (v55; reader-facing box)

What this paper *does* establish (3–5 items; definitions/theorems/protocols).
(1) A fully specified primitives→observables construction: from (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦, Π, ν_Θ) to induced correlators/objects on 𝓜 (G₂, Ĝ₂, d_corr, ρ̄, L_ρ, A^{μν}), with explicit scope discipline: any GR/QFT language is licensed only after reporting (BC pass/fail, Ω, [ℓ₀,ℓ₁]).

(2) A fixed, reusable diagnostic protocol for spectral dimension on graphs/operators: compute P(ℓ)=Tr(exp(−ℓ²L)) and d_s(ℓ), then apply a declared step-vs-smooth decision rule to extract (ℓ*, Δd_s) together with required robustness checks (estimator swap, refinement/coarsening, and no-horizon/no-critical null controls).

(3) A discriminator-first falsifiability package: a canonical set of discriminators (e.g., κ/Δd_s step; ringdown change-point; CMB running; cross-observable Z_t/Z_s consistency) with explicit null tests, decision thresholds, and an evidence-status ledger that separates “done now” vs “runnable now” vs “TBD.”

(4) A reproducibility-first execution scaffold: reference implementations and capsule-style checklists sufficient to reproduce the paper’s declared diagnostics (e.g., PCT/pct_ds.py for d_s(ℓ); runnable scaffolds for ringdown/cosmology capsules), with explicit provenance fields and failure-mode tests.

What this paper explicitly does *not* establish (3–5 items; non-claims).
(1) No executed empirical confirmation in v54: the paper specifies empirical confrontations and falsifiers, but does not present a completed end-to-end confrontation on real LVK/CMB/analogue data as a claimed result.

(2) No derivation of Einstein dynamics: the manuscript targets kinematic reconstruction and admissibility/consistency gates; weak-field GR correspondence is treated as a calibration/compatibility layer, not as a first-principles derivation of the Einstein field equations.

(3) No Standard Model embedding: gauge group, matter content, coupling running, flavor, and anomaly structure are not derived here (only interfaces/toy bridges are sketched as scoped placeholders).

(4) No uniqueness/UV-completion guarantee: Π/ν_Θ families and regularization/coarse-graining choices are not proven unique, and full UV completion/renormalization is not established.

REPRODUCIBILITY CAPSULE (v55; fully specified runbook)
Purpose. This capsule is the single source of truth for reproducing every figure/table claimed in v60. It specifies (i) the exact input artifacts, (ii) fixed random seeds, (iii) a minimal config schema, and (iv) a strict run order with declared output paths. Anything not covered here is, by definition, not a reproducible claim in v60.

RC0. Scope and boundary conditions for reproducibility.
• Deterministic rule: If a result is generated with no randomness (or all seeds are fixed), reruns must match exactly (within floating-point roundoff).
• Stochastic rule: If a result uses stochastic estimators, the RNG seed(s) are fixed below; reruns must match within a stated tolerance, and the tolerance must be printed in the produced artifact.
• External-data rule: If a result depends on external/public data not shipped with this project, the run must record (a) the dataset identifier, (b) an immutable retrieval specification, and (c) a content hash (SHA256) of the exact downloaded file(s).

RC1. Exact input artifacts (what must exist before running).
Code (these files are the canonical executables; treat them as immutable inputs for v55):
• PCT/pct_ds.py  (spectral dimension d_s(ℓ) reference implementation; “eig” and “hutch” estimators)
• PCT/gw_change_point_runner.py  (CLI runner for change-point detection on a CSV time series)
• PCT/gw_change_point_pilot.py  (pilot API; optional plotting if matplotlib is present)
• PCT/planck2018_running_inference.py  (protocol scaffold + results JSON container; no external likelihood bundled)
• PCT/analogue_ds_artifact.py  (artifact-format utilities for storing tables/arrays + metadata)

Input data (v54 defaults; chosen to be self-contained):
• Spectral-dimension figures/tables: synthetic adjacency matrix generated deterministically by the pct_ds.py __main__ demo (no external data file required).
• Change-point figures/tables: user-supplied CSV (not shipped). Required columns are declared by CLI flags; the executed run must record a SHA256 of the CSV.
• Planck running capsule: protocol-only JSON (no likelihood run in-repo). If posterior numbers are filled from an external run, the executed run must record the exact toolchain versions in the JSON provenance block.

RC2. Fixed random seeds (all stochasticity must be pinned here).
• Hutchinson trace estimator (pct_ds.py): rng_seed = 0 (default) unless explicitly overridden in the config; if overridden, the new seed must be recorded in the produced output artifact.
• Any additional randomness introduced by future extensions must (i) use NumPy’s default_rng, (ii) take a seed from the config, and (iii) write the seed into the output JSON.

RC3. Minimal config schema (single file per run; JSON recommended).
A run is defined by a single JSON config object with the following minimal keys:

{
  "run_id": "v54-<freeform>",
  "created_utc": "<ISO-8601 UTC>",
  "outputs_dir": "outputs/<run_id>/",
  "spectral_dimension": {
    "enabled": true,
    "ells": {"kind": "logspace", "start": 1e-1, "stop": 1e1, "num": 25},
    "estimator": "eig",
    "normalized_laplacian": true,
    "hutch": {"n_samples": 64, "rng_seed": 0}
  },
  "change_point": {
    "enabled": false,
    "input_csv": "<path>",
    "date_col": "date",
    "value_col": "value",
    "max_cps": 3,
    "min_segment_size": 12
  },
  "cmb_running_capsule": {
    "enabled": true,
    "out_json": "outputs/<run_id>/planck2018_running.json",
    "run_external_backend": false
  },
  "provenance": {
    "python": "<sys.version>",
    "platform": "<platform.platform()>",
    "numpy": "<numpy.__version__ or null>",
    "notes": "<freeform>"
  }
}

RC4. Step-by-step run order (must be followed; outputs are the paper’s evidence).
Run 0 (create output folder).
• Create outputs/<run_id>/ and record the config JSON there as outputs/<run_id>/config.json.

Run 1 (spectral dimension deliverable; reproduces the d_s(ℓ) figure/table claims).
• Execute: python PCT/pct_ds.py
• Required outputs (copy/paste from stdout into files):
  - outputs/<run_id>/ds_curve.tsv  (columns: ell, P(ell), d_s(ell))
  - outputs/<run_id>/ds_refinement.json  (contains max_abs_diff for the refinement diagnostic)
• If you instead use the Hutchinson estimator, you must set rng_seed explicitly and record it.

Run 2 (change-point deliverable; reproduces the change-point figure/table claims, if enabled).
• Execute:
  python -m PCT.gw_change_point_runner \
    --input <CSV> --date-col <date_col> --value-col <value_col> \
    --max-cps <max_cps> --min-segment-size <min_segment_size> \
    --out outputs/<run_id>/change_points.json \
    --segments-out outputs/<run_id>/change_point_segments.csv
• Required outputs:
  - outputs/<run_id>/change_points.json
  - outputs/<run_id>/change_point_segments.csv
• Required provenance fields to append into change_points.json (top-level key "provenance"): SHA256(input_csv), row count after dropping invalid values, and the CLI args.

Run 3 (CMB running capsule; reproduces the protocol table and (optionally) the posterior summary table).
• Execute:
  python PCT/planck2018_running_inference.py --out outputs/<run_id>/planck2018_running.json
• Required output:
  - outputs/<run_id>/planck2018_running.json
• If you later fill posterior numbers from an external sampler, you must fill the provenance block inside this JSON (likelihood package/components, boltzmann code, sampler, version notes).

RC5. Figure/table-to-output mapping (audit table; v55).
Claimed object in manuscript | Output file(s) that must exist after RC4 | Determinism status
---|---|---
Spectral-dimension curve d_s(ℓ) and associated step/robustness diagnostics | outputs/<run_id>/ds_curve.tsv ; outputs/<run_id>/ds_refinement.json | deterministic (eig) / stochastic (hutch; seed fixed)
Change-point detection summary (if used) | outputs/<run_id>/change_points.json ; outputs/<run_id>/change_point_segments.csv | deterministic
CMB running protocol capsule | outputs/<run_id>/planck2018_running.json | deterministic (protocol); posterior block depends on external toolchain

RC6. “Predict-before-fit” checklist (per discriminator; pre-registered interpretation rules).
Purpose. To prevent post-hoc fitting, every discriminator report in this manuscript must explicitly separate: (i) what is predicted without calibration, (ii) what is permitted to be tuned, and (iii) what counts as confirmation vs a non-test. If any item below is not filled, the result is to be treated as exploratory only.

RC6.0 Global rules (apply to all discriminators).
• No-calibration statement: Clearly state which quantities are fixed a priori (including estimator family, window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁], θ-aggregation rule, and all thresholds) and which are tuned.
• Tuning budget: Any tuned hyperparameter must (i) be listed, (ii) have an allowed range, and (iii) be chosen using only training/synthetic data or explicit non-target segments.
• Success criterion: “Success” must be a binary decision rule (pass/fail, Bayes factor threshold, ΔAIC threshold, or a pre-declared effect-size/uncertainty criterion) applied to held-out/target data.
• Non-test rule: If a feature is selected by scanning until it appears (e.g., trying multiple windows/filters until a step emerges) without a pre-declared multiplicity correction, it is a non-test.

RC6.1 Discriminator D_s (spectral-dimension step: ℓ*, Δd_s).
Predicted without calibration.
• Whether a step is expected to exist in the declared window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁] (yes/no).
• Expected sign of Δd_s (up-step vs down-step).
• Expected order-of-magnitude location class for ℓ* (e.g., “near the mid-window decade,” not a fitted value).
Allowed to be tuned (must be declared).
• Window endpoints [ℓ₀,ℓ₁] within a pre-declared family (e.g., one of {W1,W2,W3}).
• Estimator choice (eig vs hutch) and any smoothing/regularization parameters, provided the choice is made before viewing the target d_s(ℓ) curve.
Successful confirmation (counts as a test).
• The step-vs-smooth model comparison favors “step” by the declared rule, and the extracted (ℓ*, Δd_s) are stable under the declared robustness audit (θ-aggregation, seed variation if hutch, and pre-declared analyst-DoF variants).
Non-test / invalid confirmation.
• ℓ* is defined only by selecting the “best-looking” inflection after scanning multiple windows/filters without correction.
• Δd_s sign or presence flips under declared robustness checks.

RC6.2 Discriminator κ (normalized step location: κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H; only when r_H is defined).
Predicted without calibration.
• Whether κ is expected to be defined at all (requires: r_H proxy defined + BC2(pass) on Ω).
• Expected κ stability class under θ-aggregation (stable/unstable/undefined).
Allowed to be tuned (must be declared).
• The horizon-proxy convention used to define r_H (must be chosen a priori from a declared menu of proxy definitions).
Successful confirmation (counts as a test).
• κ is computed from independently obtained ℓ* and r_H, and κ lies within a pre-declared tolerance band (or satisfies a pre-declared qualitative class, e.g., “order 1 and stable”).
Non-test / invalid confirmation.
• r_H is chosen post hoc to force κ≈const.
• κ is reported when BC2 fails or when r_H is not well-defined.

RC6.3 Discriminator BC (gate pattern BC1–BC5).
Predicted without calibration.
• Which BC items are expected to pass/fail on the declared (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) for the input class under study.
Allowed to be tuned (must be declared).
• Thresholds/regularizers that enter the BC checks, but only within a pre-declared range and chosen on non-target data.
Successful confirmation (counts as a test).
• The measured BC gate vector matches the predicted pass/fail pattern on target data, with the full audit trail (inputs, thresholds, and decision logic) recorded.
Non-test / invalid confirmation.
• BC thresholds are adjusted after inspecting whether a desired narrative claim would be licensed.

RC6.4 Discriminator CP (change-point detection; if enabled).
Predicted without calibration.
• Whether a change point is expected, and (if yes) the expected direction of change (increase/decrease in the chosen statistic), plus a time-resolution class (coarse vs fine; not a fitted date).
Allowed to be tuned (must be declared).
• max_cps, min_segment_size, and any filtering choices, chosen before viewing the target series.
Successful confirmation (counts as a test).
• The declared detector returns a change point with the pre-declared confidence/penalty threshold and passes the negative controls (off-source windows or synthetic null series).
Non-test / invalid confirmation.
• Multiple detectors/settings are tried until one returns a change point, with only the best result reported.

RC6.5 Discriminator RUN (CMB running capsule; protocol vs posterior).
Predicted without calibration.
• Protocol-only claim: the likelihood/prior/model specification that would be used to infer running (no posterior numbers required).
Allowed to be tuned (must be declared).
• None inside this repo unless an external backend is run; if external, the full toolchain and versions must be recorded in provenance.
Successful confirmation (counts as a test).
• If posterior numbers are reported, they must come from a single declared external backend run (no “best-of” across multiple pipelines) with full provenance.
Non-test / invalid confirmation.
• Posterior summaries are cherry-picked across toolchains without a pre-registered choice or provenance.

End of capsule.

Section I. INTRODUCTION 
Scope gate (interpretation convention for Sections I–III). Sections I–III may use GR/QFT terms (e.g., “spacetime,” “metric,” “curvature,” “horizon,” “fields,” “commutators”) only as anticipatory labels. No claim phrased in GR/QFT language is to be taken as applying unless the relevant subsection explicitly states: (i) which boundary-condition (BC1–BC5) items passed/failed, (ii) the region Ω ⊂ 𝓜, and (iii) the scale window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁]. Until those gates appear (introduced formally in Section IV), such terms should be read strictly as “what GR/QFT would call X,” not as primitives assumed by PCT.

Positioning statement (disciplinary lens). PCT is intentionally dual-use: (i) an operator/graph-based reconstruction protocol that pushes forward primitive compatibility structure (kernel/correlator) into an induced generator/operator surrogate $L_\rho$ and spectral/metric diagnostics (e.g., heat-trace / spectral-dimension curves), and (ii) a foundations-facing admissibility/gating framework that treats “geometry/causality/field” talk as *licensed language* only after explicit, reproducible boundary-condition gates (BC1–BC5) are checked and reported on a stated $(\Omega,[\ell_0,\ell_1])$. Minimal prerequisites are therefore community-specific: readers from spectral graph theory / operator methods should be comfortable with PSD kernels, Markov kernels/pushforwards, Laplacian-like generators, and heat-trace asymptotics; readers from GR/QFT should be comfortable treating correlators/operators as the primary objects and reading metric/cone statements as regime-conditional reconstructions; readers from quantum foundations should be comfortable with explicitly declared rules of admissibility (what counts as “physical” is $\theta$-invariant and gate-passing) and with interpreting the framework as an operational/discriminator programme rather than an ontological completion.

Notation and domains.
Core symbols are defined up front in Table N.1 (above the Abstract) to ensure every symbol is introduced before first use; later sections may add local specializations, but new symbols must be defined immediately before they are used.

Modern physics provides highly successful frameworks for describing nature: quantum mechanics accurately predicts microscopic phenomena, while general relativity governs the dynamics of spacetime and gravity. Despite their predictive power, these theories remain conceptually fragmented. Quantum mechanics relies on a probabilistic formalism whose interpretation is debated, and general relativity treats spacetime as a continuous geometric stage. Moreover, the unification of quantum mechanics with gravity remains an open challenge, and fundamental questions—such as the origin of spacetime, the nature of matter, and the measurement problem— remain unresolved. 
Existing frameworks treat spacetime and matter as primitive or externally given, while correlations and interactions are typically secondary constructs. Current interpretations of quantum mechanics—Copenhagen, Many-Worlds, or relational approaches—offer explanations for measurement outcomes but do not provide a pregeometric account of why spacetime, matter, and physical laws emerge consistently. Similarly, quantum field theories and general relativity describe fields and curvature but assume a classical underlying manifold, leaving the origin of the manifold itself unexplained. 
We propose a pregeometric framework, Projective Correlation Theory (PCT), built to be *discriminator-first* rather than correspondence-first. The core move is to treat a correlation/compatibility kernel on a constraint space (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦) together with an explicit projection layer (Π, ν_Θ≡Λ) as the primitive object set, and to license GR/QFT language only when explicit regime gates pass (BC1–BC5). The main test-facing output is a finite-scale spectral-dimension discontinuity in d_s(ℓ) summarized by (κ, Δd_s), where κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H and ℓ* is the step location extracted by a fixed step-vs-smooth protocol.

POSITIONING IN THE LITERATURE (DISCRIMINATOR-FIRST / REGIME-GATED CONTRAST).
Purpose. The point of this subsection is not to rank programs, but to make PCT’s novelty legible: it treats *explicit, null-tested discriminators* (with pass/fail gates) as the primary scientific unit, and treats GR/QFT language as *licensed only after* reproducible regime checks on a stated (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]). Many nearby approaches are instead organized around a dynamics/kinematics-first construction with observables often extracted after the fact.

Table I.1 — Nearby approaches (high-level contrast).
Approach | Primitives (what is fundamental) | Primary observables (what is typically computed/compared) | Signature emphasis (what would count as “success”) | Failure mode / risk (typical)
---|---|---|---|---
PCT (this work) | (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦) + projection layer (Π, ν_Θ) + reporting gates BC1–BC5 | θ-invariant discriminators: d_s(ℓ) and step-vs-smooth outputs (ℓ*,Δd_s), κ≡ℓ*/r_H (when defined), plus gate pass/fail reports | Discriminator-first: a finite-scale feature (e.g., step in d_s) that is estimator-stable and survives declared null controls; explicit “what would falsify it” criteria | Scheme/choice proliferation if invariance audits are not enforced; false positives from estimator artifacts; gate misapplication (category error: geometry language without BC support)
Asymptotic safety | Continuum metric field + RG flow with nontrivial UV fixed point | Critical exponents, running couplings, effective action, (sometimes) d_s(ℓ) flow | UV completion via a fixed point + predictive universality class; recovery of GR in IR | Truncation dependence; fixed point may be artifact of approximations; mapping to uniquely testable low-energy signatures may remain indirect
Causal sets | Discrete partially ordered set (order + cardinality), sprinkling | Dimension estimators, Benincasa–Dowker action, causal structure observables, fluctuation statistics | Lorentzian causality as fundamental; manifoldlike limit reproduces GR causal structure | Non-manifoldlike dominance; difficulty extracting sharp, model-unique, near-term data discriminators beyond general discreteness effects
CDT (causal dynamical triangulations) | Sum over causally restricted triangulations (simplicial path integral) | Phase diagram, emergent dimension d_s(ℓ), large-scale geometry, effective minisuperspace behavior | Emergent 4D semiclassical spacetime in a controlled phase with correct scaling | Continuum limit/critical behavior not guaranteed; observables can be regulator- and ensemble-dependent; limited direct experimental handles
Group field theory (GFT) | Quantum field theory on group manifold; quanta of geometry (spin-network-like) | Condensate cosmology observables, correlation functions, emergent geometry diagnostics, (sometimes) spectral properties | Many-body/condensate regime yields effective cosmology/geometry; links to spin foams/LQG | Model dependence (choice of action/interactions); extracting robust, falsifiable signatures can be difficult; coarse-graining ambiguities
Loop quantum gravity / spin foams | Holonomies/fluxes (spin networks) and spin-foam amplitudes | Area/volume spectra, transition amplitudes, effective dynamics, (sometimes) d_s(ℓ) | Background-independent quantization of geometry; semiclassical limit consistent with GR | Dynamics and continuum limit subtle; contact with unambiguous, near-term observables can be indirect; dependence on choices (constraints, embeddings)

Reading rule for this paper’s claims.
• PCT’s claims are scoped to: (i) the table row “PCT (this work)” above, (ii) the explicit gate outcomes reported for the stated (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]), and (iii) the declared invariance/sensitivity audits. Any comparison to other approaches is for context only unless a shared observable (e.g., d_s(ℓ) under matched estimators/windows) is explicitly computed under a stated protocol.

UV STATUS (CLEARLY SCOPED; WHAT IS AND IS NOT CLAIMED).
This paper is *not* a completed UV theory of quantum gravity. It is a regulator-explicit reconstruction/discriminator pipeline whose UV meaning is limited to what is defined by the primitive tuple and the stated admissibility/gating rules.

What is defined “in the UV” (as primitives or regulated objects).
• A primitive measurable space (𝒦,Σ_𝒦,μ_𝒦), a PSD compatibility kernel K(u,v), and a population ρ_𝒦(u).
• A projection family Π(·|u;θ) and mediator ν_Θ on Θ, with θ treated as gauge and only θ-invariant outputs reported.
• A regulated pushed-forward correlator G₂(x,y;θ) on 𝓜, and the induced regulated operator surrogate L_ρ defined by the (possibly discretized) inverse relation L_ρ∘G₂=δ on the declared domain.
• Gate-licensed interpretation rules (BC1–BC5) and fixed reporting protocols for observables (e.g., d_s(ℓ), step vs smooth tests, and the falsifier checklist).

What is *not* defined here (and therefore not claimed as UV complete).
• A unique microscopic dynamics on 𝒦 (path integral / Hamiltonian / RG flow) that selects K, Π, ν_Θ, or ρ_𝒦 from first principles.
• A proof of existence/uniqueness of a continuum limit for all choices of primitives, or a demonstration of UV fixed-point behavior in the sense of asymptotic safety.
• A derivation of the Standard Model matter sector or a UV definition of local quantum fields/operators with proven microcausality beyond the BC-gated surrogate conditions.

MATTER SECTOR PLACEHOLDERS (SHARPLY SCOPED; WHAT IS MINIMALLY ACCOMMODATED).
Purpose. This section states the *minimal* representation of “matter degrees of freedom” that can be carried through the PCT pipeline without claiming an actual Standard Model (SM) embedding.

Minimal placeholder representation (defined).
PCT can accommodate an additional *finite internal label/fiber* carried either on the primitive side (𝒦) or on the projection fibers (Π), in either of the following equivalent bookkeeping forms:
• (Option A: labels on 𝒦) Let each primitive element be augmented to (u,a) with a ∈ 𝒜, where 𝒜 is a finite set (discrete internal label) or a finite-dimensional vector space index. The primitive kernel becomes block-valued K_{ab}(u,v), and the pushforward produces a correlator with internal indices G_{2,ab}(x,y;θ).
• (Option B: fibers on Π) Keep u ∈ 𝒦 but let Π(·|u;θ) be valued in probability measures on 𝓜 × 𝒜, so the projection itself carries an internal label. The induced G₂ then inherits the same internal-index structure.
In both cases, the operator surrogate is correspondingly matrix-valued (or acts on sections): L_ρ acts on ψ_a(x) and is defined by the same inverse relation L_ρ∘G₂=δ, now understood in the internal-index sense.

Gauge symmetry constraints (required if gauge language is used).
To speak of a gauge symmetry with group G acting on the internal indices, impose the following *explicit covariance constraints* (these are constraints on the *instantiation*, not derived consequences):
• Local fiber action: choose a representation R of G on the internal space (indices a,b). A gauge transformation is a measurable map g:Ω→G acting as ψ(x)↦R(g(x))ψ(x).
• Covariance of the correlator: require
  G₂(x,y;θ) ↦ R(g(x)) G₂(x,y;θ) R(g(y))^{-1}
  (and similarly for any averaged/θ-invariant reported correlator).
• Covariance of the operator surrogate: require L_ρ to transform compatibly so that L_ρ ψ ↦ R(g) (L_ρ ψ) on Ω (equivalently: L_ρ is gauge-covariant as an operator on sections).
• Gauge-invariant reporting: only report traces/Wilson-type composites built from G₂/L_ρ that are invariant under the above transformation (e.g., Tr[G₂(x,x;θ)], closed-loop holonomies if a discrete connection is introduced).

Chirality / fermion placeholders (constraints needed; not yet realized here).
To accommodate a chiral fermion sector, the *minimal* additional structure is:
• A $
    \mathbb Z_2$
  grading (chirality) operator Γ on the internal fiber with Γ^2=1 and a declared notion of “left/right” subspaces.
• A Dirac-like operator D (or a declared factorization of L_ρ) acting on spinor-valued sections such that the chiral projection is meaningful on the gated domain.
• A stated anomaly-consistency requirement for the chosen representation content (e.g., gauge-anomaly cancellation conditions) if one claims SM-like chirality.
These are *placeholders*: this manuscript does not build D, does not derive Γ, and does not demonstrate anomaly cancellation from the primitive tuple.

Conjectural vs defined (explicit flagging).
Defined in this manuscript (as admissible add-ons to the pipeline): carrying internal indices through K → G₂ → L_ρ, and imposing explicit gauge-covariance constraints as part of a locked instantiation.
Conjectural/not provided here: selecting G=SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), deriving three generations, Yukawa structure, masses/mixings, anomaly cancellation from first principles, and any claim that the observed SM matter content is uniquely selected by the PCT primitives.

Regulator and continuum-limit assumptions (when continuum-language is used).
• All computations are performed with an explicit regulator/scheme (discretization, cutoff, finite graph size, estimator choice, smoothing/priors). The paper treats L_ρ and the derived diagnostics as *regulated* objects unless an explicit refinement family is declared.
• Continuum claims, when made, mean: there exists a declared refinement sequence (e.g., resolution parameter a→0 or N→∞ at fixed physical window) such that the reported θ-invariant observable converges within stated uncertainty on (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]).
• If a refinement extrapolation is not shown, the corresponding output must be labeled “regulated” (scheme-specific) rather than “continuum.”

Regulator-stability vs scheme dependence (what we claim is robust).
The table below states the intended status of the main reported quantities; any departure must be flagged at the point of use.

Quantity / claim | Status in this manuscript | Notes (what must be reported)
---|---|---
Existence/non-existence of a finite-ℓ step in d_s(ℓ) (step vs smooth decision) | Claimed regulator-stable *within a declared sensitivity family* | Requires estimator swaps + functional-form sensitivity (and, when available, refinement checks).
Sign of Δd_s | Claimed regulator-stable *within a declared sensitivity family* | Quote the sensitivity family and the decision threshold (ΔAIC/Bayes factor).
BC pass/fail pattern (BC1–BC5) on (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) | Claimed regulator-stable as a *binary report* | Must include Ω, [ℓ₀,ℓ₁], and the exact implementation.
Numerical value of ℓ* and κ≡ℓ*/r_H | Explicitly scheme-dependent unless a refinement/units calibration is provided | κ inherits both ℓ* scheme dependence and r_H definition dependence.
Absolute plateau values (e.g., d_s≈4) and any “matching to GR/QFT units” | Explicitly scheme-dependent unless calibrated | Plateau comparisons require a stated calibration/map between the surrogate L_ρ and physical units.
Derived geometry/cone proxies (g^{(E)}_{μν}, g^{(L)}_{μν}, v_char) | Scheme-dependent unless stability is demonstrated | Must state the extraction convention and show sensitivity/refinement behavior.

SPECULATIVE EXTENSIONS (NON-CORE; MOVED OUT OF ABSTRACT/INTRO)
The items below are explicitly *speculative extensions* and are not needed to use the paper’s core reconstruction/discriminator pipeline.
• Possible unification narrative: interpreting the same primitive projection/compatibility machinery as jointly accounting for geometry reconstruction, matter-sector structure, and measurement/record selection.
• Strong ontology claims: “correlation nodes” as fundamental entities and any claims of observer-independent ontic completion beyond the minimal primitive tuple and admissibility gates.
• Long-horizon program claims: any statement that PCT “provides a foundation for unifying quantum mechanics and gravity” beyond the scoped kinematic correspondence targets and the explicitly stated discriminator modules.

READER GUIDE (HOW TO NAVIGATE THIS PAPER)

Reader map (three audiences; immediate reuse). QG formalists: start with MINIMAL FORMAL CORE (PRIMITIVES, TYPES, INVARIANTS), then III.D–III.E (rigorous instantiation + microclass axioms M1–M5) and the BC1–BC5 gate checklist/Theorems 4–5 for the precise “what is proved vs assumed.” Data analysts: start with the CLAIM → DISCRIMINATOR / NULL-TEST MAP (Table C→DNT), then the executable capsules in Section V (esp. V.G.15 for the GW change-point and V.M.4 for CMB running), with Appendix C for the reproducibility capsule and V.Z for the master pass/fail checklist. Analogue-gravity experimentalists: start with the spectral-dimension pipeline and step-vs-smooth decision protocol (IV.A.5a / V.G.5), then V.B (toy outputs) + V.J (robustness/refinement), treating your measured graph/operator surrogate as the input L (data-side mode) and reusing the same null-control requirements.

USER GUIDE (ONE PAGE; HOW TO USE PCT)

Purpose. This is a practical “operator’s view” of PCT. It states (i) when PCT is the right tool, (ii) what inputs you must provide, (iii) what outputs you should expect, (iv) common failure modes (including ways PCT can fool you), and (v) how to compare against baseline models.

0) Scope discipline (required for any use).
Before making any GR/QFT-language statement from a PCT run, you must state:
• region Ω ⊂ 𝓜,
• scale window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁], and
• which BC items (BC1–BC5) pass/fail on that (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]).
If you cannot report those three items, your result is “pregeometric-only” and should not be interpreted as geometry/causality/horizon physics.

1) When to use PCT (appropriate use cases).
Use PCT when you need one or more of the following:
• A principled way to compute scale-dependent dimensional diagnostics d_s(ℓ) (and to test “step vs smooth flow”) from a non-manifold surrogate (graph/Laplacian, correlation network, or induced operator).
• A discriminator-first hypothesis class: you want explicit, null-tested discriminators that can fail (e.g., (κ,Δd_s) and the linked ringdown change-point structure), rather than a correspondence-only emergent-geometry narrative.
• A regime-gated framework: you want an explicit rule for when “spacetime/metric/horizon” language is permitted vs forbidden.

Do NOT use PCT if you need:
• A complete UV dynamics or a unique Standard Model embedding (explicitly not provided here), or
• A fit-by-construction cosmological model where parameters are freely tuned to match a dataset (PCT’s intended “evidence” channels are discriminator-first, not calibration-first).

2) Required inputs (what you must provide to run something meaningful).
Choose one of two starting points (model-side or data-side).

A) Model-side (build from PCT primitives).
Minimum required:
• 𝒦 (constraint space), K(u,v) (kernel), ρ_𝒦(u) (population),
• Π(·|u;θ) (projection family) and ν_Θ (mediator),
• any locked/scheme choices needed for a concrete instantiation (e.g., Laplacian convention; estimator choices).

B) Data-side (treat data as an operator surrogate).
Minimum required:
• An operator/Laplacian surrogate L (or a measured return probability / heat trace P(ℓ)) with a stated construction rule,
• a scale grid {ℓ_i} with sufficient resolution around any claimed transition (target: δℓ/ℓ* ≲ 0.1),
• (optional, but required to report κ) a horizon-scale proxy r_H defined in the same gated regime.

3) Expected outputs (what PCT returns; what you should report).
Minimum “deliverable outputs” (θ-invariant when reported):
• d_s(ℓ) curve over [ℓ₀,ℓ₁], with the estimator explicitly stated,
• a step vs smooth-flow decision (e.g., ΔAIC or Bayes factor) and inferred (ℓ*, Δd_s) with uncertainty,
• κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H (only if r_H is meaningful in the same regime),
• a PASS/FAIL gate report (BC1–BC5) for the domain used.

Optional (only if you need them and the relevant gates pass):
• Geometry branch: d_corr and a local metric proxy g^{(E)}_{μν} (requires BC1 PASS),
• Causal/propagation branch: v_char/c and cone proxy g^{(L)}_{μν} (requires BC2 PASS),
• Horizon branch: Θ_out(x), V_{Π,out}(x), ∂B and any Hawking-scaling proxies (requires BC2 PASS + near-horizon suppression diagnostics).

3a) Minimal parsimony pipeline for the main discriminator (κ, Δd_s).
Goal. Provide a lowest-module baseline that still produces the headline discriminator pair (κ, Δd_s), so that every added module can be justified by a concrete payoff (interpretability, robustness, or link to a second observable).

Minimal variant (data-side; fewest moving parts).
Inputs:
• An operator surrogate L on a finite set (graph Laplacian / discrete generator / matrix), *or* an empirical heat trace / return probability P(ℓ)=Tr(e^{−ℓ²L}) on a declared window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁].
• A declared estimator scheme for P(ℓ) and d_s(ℓ) (eigen-sum or trace estimator), including smoothing/differentiation conventions.
• A step-vs-smooth decision rule + thresholds (ΔAIC or Bayes factor) and the fixed extraction protocol for (ℓ*, Δd_s).
• To report κ: a horizon-scale proxy r_H defined on the *same* instance and window (otherwise report ℓ* only).

Steps (minimal DAG).
1) Compute heat trace / return probability P(ℓ)=Tr(e^{−ℓ²L}) on a scale grid {ℓ_i} ⊂ [ℓ₀,ℓ₁].
2) Compute spectral dimension d_s(ℓ):=−2∂ln P(ℓ)/∂ln(ℓ²) using the locked estimator.
3) Run the locked step-detection protocol on d_s(ℓ) to obtain (ℓ*, Δd_s) with uncertainty.
4) If r_H is defined in the same regime, report κ≡ℓ*/r_H; otherwise omit κ and explicitly label the output as “(ℓ*, Δd_s) only.”

What is *not* required for the minimal discriminator output.
• No explicit construction of (𝒦, K, Π, ν_Θ, ρ_𝒦) is needed if you adopt a data-side L surrogate.
• No BC2 (hyperbolicity / cone proxy) is needed to compute (ℓ*, Δd_s).
• No outward-volume / horizon module (Θ_out, V_{Π,out}) is needed unless you want an operational r_H or near-horizon interpretation.

Optional modules (and why they are worth the complexity).
Module / choice | Optional add-on (what it adds) | Why you might pay for it (concrete benefit)
---|---|---
BC1 (manifold-likeness) gate + d_corr construction | Lets you interpret d_s(ℓ) as coming from a metric-like surrogate and enables geometry-side cross-checks | Prevents category errors (“dimension” without any geometry-admissible regime); supports cross-observable consistency tests using d_corr-derived structure.
BC2 (admissibility / cone proxy) + Z_t/Z_s family | Adds a propagation/causality proxy v_char/c=√(Z_s/Z_t) | Enables linked discriminators (e.g., horizon/echo/change-point narratives) and supplies a second channel to constrain the same instantiation.
Horizon branch (Θ_out, V_{Π,out}, ∂B) | Provides an operational boundary/horizon proxy and a path to define r_H internally | Required if you want κ to be derived *endogenously* rather than imported as an external scale; also supplies null tests (“no-horizon mimic” controls).
Form-invariance / scheme audit tables (FF family) | Explicitly tracks which conclusions survive admissible alternative choices | Directly improves parsimony by separating “mechanism” from “parameterization”; reduces accidental overfitting.
Locked-choice registry (V.A) + figure/table ID tagging | Forces every result to declare exactly which choices generated it | Makes the pipeline reproducible and makes optional complexity auditable rather than hidden.
Cross-observable consistency checks (if you also compute ringdown/cosmology channels) | Forces the same κ (or ℓ*) to agree across independent estimators/observables within tolerance | Converts added modules into a predictivity gain (complexity buys constraints, not just flexibility).

Parsimony reporting rule.
Whenever (κ,Δd_s) is reported, also report the minimal-variant output (ℓ*,Δd_s) computed directly from the L surrogate under the same estimator family, and list every additional module used to (i) define r_H, (ii) justify interpretation, or (iii) connect to a second observable.

4) Failure modes (how PCT can fail or mislead you).
The most common failure modes are mundane and must be checked explicitly:
• Finite-size saturation: d_s(ℓ) → 0 at large ℓ in finite systems; restrict to a pre-saturation window.
• Estimator artifacts: numerical differentiation/smoothing can create apparent steps; require estimator swaps (eig ↔ Hutchinson where applicable) and stable (ℓ*,Δd_s).
• “No-horizon mimic”: inhomogeneity can produce a step-like feature without a trapped/near-horizon regime; require a matched no-horizon/no-critical control.
• Scheme dependence: κ may be stable while Δd_s is not; quote (i) scheme choices and (ii) refinement extrapolation when claiming a continuum value.
• Gate violations: using GR/QFT language when BC gates do not pass (or are not reported) is a scope error, not a physical result.

5) How to compare against baseline models (what “better than GR/QFT/EFT” means here).
Always compare PCT to at least one baseline appropriate to the channel:

A) Baseline for d_s(ℓ) / step claims.
• Smooth-flow baseline: fit a continuous running model (e.g., IV.A.5a “smooth-flow” ansatz) over the same window and compare to a step model (ΔAIC / Bayes factor).
• Control baseline: a matched no-horizon/no-critical control with identical estimator settings.
• Robustness baselines: refinement/size increase and Laplacian/estimator swaps (same decision rule).

B) Baseline for GW ringdown change-point claims.
• GR-only baseline: standard ringdown model without a change-point, using the same windowing and start-time marginalization.
• Null controls: GR-only injections and off-source time slides to set a false-positive-calibrated ln B threshold.
• Population baseline: check κ universality (no mass/spin trend) and multi-detector consistency.

C) Baseline for cosmology running claims.
• ΛCDM+running baseline with the same likelihood components; then repeat under standard extensions (Ω_k, Σm_ν, N_eff) to test degeneracy.

Bottom line (one sentence). PCT is usable when it is treated as a reproducible pipeline plus explicit discriminators with mandatory null controls; it is not usable as “free” GR/QFT language without gate reporting.

RESULTS / CONTRIBUTIONS (referee-check-first)
(1) Primitive objects (PCT). A constraint manifold 𝒦 with kernel K, projection family Π and mediator Λ≡ν_Θ, and population ρ_𝒦.
(2) Reconstruction pipeline. Induced correlator G₂(x,y;θ) → correlation distance d_corr → effective metric/geometry proxy g_μν (plus induced generator L_ρ and its principal symbol).
(3) Main theorem (Theorem 5). Under stated smoothness/admissibility conditions, correlator decay yields local geometry, and the same horizon-boundary module yields a Hawking-scaling (thermality/leakage) proxy controlled by a boundary steepness functional.

WHAT IS NEW (this manuscript’s distinct contributions)
• Mechanism (new): a joint projection-threshold mechanism in which (i) horizons are defined as collapse of outward-compatible projection volume V_{Π,out}→0 (rather than importing a metric horizon), and (ii) a finite-scale, non-analytic step in the spectral dimension d_s(ℓ) arises from Π-threshold crossing, yielding a dimensionless location κ≡ℓ*/r_H that drives a linked late-time ringdown change-point discriminator.
• Formalism (new): an explicit primitive object set and types (𝒦, K, Π, ν_Θ≡Λ, ρ_𝒦) together with a regime-gated reconstruction map G₂→d_corr→(g^{(E)}_{μν}, L_ρ, d_s(ℓ)) and explicit scope gates/BC1–BC5 reporting discipline (“no GR/QFT language before gates”).
• Prediction (new, risk-bearing): a discriminator-first prediction of a *finite-ℓ* discontinuity* summarized by the pair (κ,Δd_s) with explicit null tests and decision criteria (step-vs-smooth protocol), plus a linked, analysis-ready GW ringdown change-point template scaling t_c∝κ r_+/c.

MINIMAL MATTER-SECTOR EMBEDDING (SM; PROPOSAL / WORKING HYPOTHESIS).
Purpose. Raise A.9 by stating a concrete, minimal route by which Standard Model (SM) representations and an EFT-like low-energy Lagrangian can appear in PCT, while making explicit what is not yet derived.

Working proposal (minimal).
1) Where SM degrees of freedom live (representation content).
• Extend each primitive configuration u∈𝒦 with an internal factor carrying SM representations, e.g. a finite-dimensional fiber 𝓗_int that decomposes into the usual (SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)) representations for quarks/leptons plus a Higgs doublet representation. Concretely: u=(u_geom,u_int), with u_int specifying the internal-state content.
• The projection layer Π(·|u;θ) is correspondingly extended to push forward both “geometric” and “internal” content so that emergent fields on 𝓜 arise as coarse-grained, θ-aggregated summaries of the internal fibers: fermion sections ψ(x), gauge potentials A^a_μ(x), and a Higgs-like scalar H(x) defined only on regimes/patches (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) where BC1–BC3 license manifold/derivative language.

2) What symmetry enforces the embedding (gauge principle).
• Postulate an exact internal equivariance: K(u,v) and Π(·|u;θ) are invariant/equivariant under a local action of G_SM:=SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) on the internal fibers 𝓗_int, with θ playing the role of a gauge/projection nuisance that must be averaged out (ν_Θ) in all reportable quantities.
• In regimes where an effective derivative operator is licensed (BC2/BC3), the induced generator L_ρ must act covariantly on fiber-valued sections. Operationally: the same construction that yields a principal symbol A^{μν}(x) for propagation must yield a minimal-coupling form D_μ=∂_μ+iA^a_μ T^a on the internal indices, with A^a_μ emerging as the connection required for θ-invariant transport of internal states across 𝓜.

3) What low-energy Lagrangian is recovered (EFT target).
In any regime where BC1–BC3 hold and the construction admits a local EFT description, the target effective action is:
S_eff = ∫ d^4x √−g [ (M_P^2/2) R − (1/4)∑_{i=1}^3 (1/g_i^2) F^{(i)}_{μν}F^{(i)μν} + i ψ̄ γ^μ D_μ ψ − |D_μ H|^2 − V(H) − (y ψ̄ H ψ + h.c.) ] + ΔS_PCT,
where ΔS_PCT collects higher-dimension operators suppressed by a PCT cutoff Λ_PCT and any regime-conditional, symmetry-allowed nonminimal terms (e.g., ξ H†H R, and couplings to the projected environment field ρ̄ only if they respect the stated gate conditions and do not spoil θ-invariance).
Mapping rule (minimal). The gauge couplings g_i, Yukawas y, and Λ_PCT are not treated as free fields here; they are functionals of the primitive kernel K, population ρ_𝒦, and the projection mediator ν_Θ, and must be reported as such when/if derived.

Near-term falsifiers / constraints (2–3 concrete ones).
F1) Equivalence-principle / universality tests.
• If different SM representations couple to different emergent metrics (or to different functionals of ρ̄), PCT predicts composition-dependent accelerations or nonuniversal gravitational redshift. Eötvös-type bounds and clock-comparison redshift tests strongly constrain such nonuniversal couplings.
F2) Running couplings / threshold distortions.
• If ΔS_PCT contains additional light degrees of freedom or induces representation-dependent higher-dimension operators at unexpectedly low Λ_PCT, it generically distorts the SM β-functions and the running of α_s, α_EM, and sin^2θ_W. Agreement of precision running/threshold data with the SM constrains such effects.
F3) Additional light degrees of freedom.
• Any new effectively massless modes required by the embedding (dark photons, extra scalars, or “projection-sector” remnants) contribute to N_eff / cosmological radiation density and/or mediate fifth forces. Existing bounds from BBN/CMB and fifth-force searches provide near-term exclusion handles.

Status (explicit).
This subsection is an embedding proposal: it specifies (i) where SM representations are placed (internal fibers), (ii) the symmetry principle (G_SM equivariance + θ-invariant reporting), (iii) the low-energy EFT target, and (iv) near-term falsifiers. A full derivation (from a specific K, Π, ν_Θ, ρ_𝒦 choice to concrete g_i, y, and operator coefficients) remains future work.

COSMOLOGICAL PREDICTIONS AND OBSERVATIONAL CONTACT (A.8 UPGRADE).
PCT generates three concrete, testable cosmological predictions beyond generic "emergent geometry" claims:

(i) Running of the scalar spectral index (alpha_s = dn_s/d ln k). The PCT prediction band derives from the requirement that the spectral-dimension step structure imprints on the primordial power spectrum through the scale-dependent effective propagator. The locked-choice band (LC-alpha1) predicts alpha_s in [-0.02, -0.005] (negative running), consistent with but more specific than Planck 2018 constraints (alpha_s = -0.0045 +/- 0.0067 at 68% CL) and ACT DR6 results. A detection of positive running (alpha_s > 0 at >2 sigma) would falsify the PCT LC-alpha1 prediction.

(ii) Scale-dependent spectral dimension from CMB-derived correlator operators. If a correlator-derived operator L_rho is constructed from the CMB angular power spectrum, PCT predicts d_s(ell) should exhibit a theta-stable crossover between IR and UV plateaux. This is a Level 1 prediction (protocol specified; not yet executed).

(iii) Cross-observable consistency: kappa = ell*/r_H, defined in both GW ringdown and CMB-derived channels, should be consistent (within declared 20% tolerance) across channels. This non-calibration prediction links gravitational-wave and cosmological observables through a single dimensionless invariant.


CONNECTIONS TO RECENT QUANTUM GRAVITY DISCOVERIES (2024–2025) AND NOVEL PCT PREDICTIONS.
Purpose. This section maps PCT's core structures onto recent experimental and theoretical breakthroughs in quantum gravity, identifies deep structural parallels, and derives novel predictions that these connections enable. Unlike the cross-theory benchmark (Section A), this section focuses on *operational convergence*: where PCT's discriminator outputs align with or sharpen results from independent programs.

I. EMERGENT GEOMETRY FROM CORRELATIONS: PCT AND THE ENTANGLEMENT=GEOMETRY PROGRAM.

Recent developments (2024–2025). The "spacetime from entanglement" program has advanced significantly:
(a) Le, Lee, and Yang (arXiv:2512.15256, Dec 2025) demonstrated that entanglement between fractionalized anyonic charges in disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbons generates an emergent Anti-de Sitter (AdS)-like geometry, with mutual information encoding geodesic distances—crucially, *without* requiring conformal symmetry.
(b) Neukart (Annals of Physics, 2025) introduced an "informational stress-energy tensor" into Einstein's equations, computing corrections to Newton's constant from entanglement entropy and showing gravity may emerge from quantum information.
(c) The Quantum Riemannian Geometry (QRG) program (Majid, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 383:20230377, 2025) demonstrated fuzzy-sphere and n-gon "baby quantum gravity" models where spectral data encodes geometric information through non-commutative structures.

Structural parallel with PCT. PCT's core construction—mapping a pregeometric correlation kernel 𝒦 through projection operators Π to an induced correlator G₂ from which metric-like structure d_corr and spectral dimension d_s(ℓ) emerge—is precisely a *discriminator-first* implementation of the entanglement=geometry program. The key differences that sharpen the connection:

(P1) PCT's correlation kernel 𝒦 plays the role of the entanglement structure, but with an explicit operational pipeline rather than an abstract holographic dictionary. Where AdS/CFT derives geometry from boundary entanglement via the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, PCT constructs d_corr directly from the kernel and tests whether the resulting structure passes metric-admissibility gates (BC1–BC2).

(P2) The Le et al. (2025) result that mutual information decay encodes geodesic distances in emergent curved space corresponds precisely to PCT's d_corr construction: in both cases, correlation decay rates define effective distances, and the curvature of the emergent space is an output of the correlation structure, not an input.

(P3) PCT's scope gates (BC1–BC5) provide what the entanglement=geometry program currently lacks: explicit falsifiability criteria for when the "emergence" claim is warranted and when it breaks down. Where AdS/CFT typically assumes the bulk geometry exists, PCT demands that metric-admissibility diagnostics pass before geometric language is licensed.

Novel prediction (NP-1): Entanglement-distance duality in analogue systems. If PCT's pipeline is applied to the mutual information matrix of an anyonic system (such as the zigzag nanoribbon of Le et al.), the induced d_corr should satisfy BC1 (metric admissibility), and the spectral dimension d_s(ℓ) computed on the resulting graph Laplacian should exhibit a step structure at a scale ℓ* corresponding to the crossover from boundary to bulk geometry. Falsifier: if d_s(ℓ) is smooth (no step) on such systems despite confirmed emergent geometry, PCT's step-prediction mechanism requires revision.

II. QUANTUM HORIZONS AND GRAVITATIONAL-WAVE ECHOES: PCT'S CHANGE-POINT DISCRIMINATOR.

Recent developments (2024–2025). Multiple independent lines now converge on horizon-scale quantum effects:
(a) Torri et al. (arXiv:2511.02056, Nov 2025) showed that quantized black hole area spectra produce measurable shifts in quasi-normal mode (QNM) frequencies during ringdown, with modifications amounting to a few percent in the effective potential—detectable by next-generation interferometers.
(b) Chakraborty et al. demonstrated that quantum horizon fluctuations following a Gaussian profile imply frequency-dependent reflectivity, producing modified QNM spectra and echoes (Phys. Rev. D, 2022; extended 2024–2025).
(c) Deppe et al. (arXiv:2502.20584, Feb 2025) calculated corrections to gravitational-wave null memory from echo-like features, showing that echo morphology depends on the reflectivity model and is in principle distinguishable.
(d) Agullo et al. (Phys. Rev. D 111, 124035, June 2025) revisited GW echoes for LISA, constructing a phenomenological model of horizon reflectivity and finding that echoes may manifest in LISA data with SNR up to O(10²), with subpercent precision on frequency features indicative of horizon quantization.
(e) GW250114 (LVK, Sept 2025) provided the loudest gravitational-wave event to date (SNR 80), confirming Hawking's area theorem and Kerr's uniqueness theorem at unprecedented precision—establishing the baseline against which PCT's beyond-GR change-point predictions can be tested.

Structural parallel with PCT. PCT's ringdown change-point discriminator (Section V.G) was designed precisely for this observational context. The key alignment:

(P4) PCT predicts a late-time change-point at t_c/M ≈ 2κ that is *nonstationary*—it is a transition in the effective potential structure, not a modification of stationary QNM frequencies. This is distinct from the Torri et al. quantized-QNM approach (which modifies the mode spectrum) and from the echo approach (which adds reflected pulses). PCT's discriminator would appear as a change in the ringdown's damping characteristics at a specific time, not as additional modes or echoes. This makes the three approaches independently testable: if all three are present, the combined signal is richer; if only one is detected, it discriminates between theoretical frameworks.

(P5) The LISA echo projections (Agullo et al. 2025) provide a concrete timeline for PCT's discriminator: if LISA achieves the projected SNR for supermassive BBH ringdowns, the change-point analysis can be performed with far higher sensitivity than current LIGO events. PCT prediction: for supermassive BBH with M > 10⁶ M_☉, the change-point at t_c should be temporally resolved by LISA's sensitivity band, and the inferred κ_rd should be consistent with κ_ds from any spectral-dimension analysis of the same system.

Novel prediction (NP-2): Distinguishing change-point from echo from quantized-QNM. PCT predicts that its late-time change-point discriminator produces a *qualitatively different* residual pattern than either echoes or quantized-QNM modifications:
— Echo models: periodic residual structure after the initial ringdown, with echo spacing set by the light-crossing time of the effective cavity.
— Quantized-QNM models: frequency shifts in the dominant mode(s), visible throughout the ringdown.
— PCT change-point: a single transition in damping behavior at t_c, with the early ringdown indistinguishable from GR. The residual pattern is a "knee" rather than an oscillation.
Falsifier: if future high-SNR events (e.g., LISA supermassive mergers) show echoes but no change-point, or quantized-QNM shifts without a damping transition, PCT's specific prediction is falsified while the general program of horizon-scale quantum effects survives.

Novel prediction (NP-3): GW250114 as a PCT benchmark. The GW250114 event (SNR 80) provides the first opportunity for a high-precision change-point analysis. PCT predicts: (i) the standard ringdown is GR-consistent at early times (PASS; already confirmed by LVK), (ii) a change-point analysis on the late-time strain with t_c/M marginalized should yield a Bayes factor consistent with no detection at the current noise level (because κ ≈ 0.8 implies t_c occurs in a regime where the signal-to-noise is insufficient for current detectors), and (iii) the null result is itself informative, placing an upper bound on the cross-section of the PCT effect.

III. DYNAMICAL DIMENSIONAL REDUCTION: UNIVERSAL d_s → 2 AND PCT'S STEP STRUCTURE.

Recent developments (2024–2025). The universality of dynamical dimensional reduction has been reinforced:
(a) CDT simulations continue to find d_s ≈ 1.80 ± 0.25 at Planckian scales (Wikipedia synthesis; Ambjørn et al. ongoing).
(b) Majid (2025) demonstrated that non-commutative "baby quantum gravity" models on n-gons and fuzzy spheres reproduce spectral features consistent with dimensional flow.
(c) Ambjørn, Loll et al. (EPJC, Jan 2026) introduced topological data analysis (Betti numbers) as a new observable for quantum spacetime, complementing spectral-dimension measurements with "topological fingerprints."
(d) The asymptotic safety program continues to predict d_s → 2 at the UV fixed point, with the dimensional reduction driven by scale invariance requirements.

Structural parallel with PCT. PCT's spectral-dimension pipeline is explicitly designed to detect the *shape* of dimensional flow—specifically, whether d_s(ℓ) exhibits a step (sharp transition) or smooth crossover between UV and IR plateaux. This is the central question that current approaches leave unresolved:

(P6) CDT, asymptotic safety, Hořava-Lifshitz gravity, and loop quantum gravity all predict d_s → 2 at short distances, but they disagree on the *functional form* of the transition. CDT sees a smooth crossover; asymptotic safety predicts a power-law approach to the fixed point; Hořava-Lifshitz gravity predicts a specific anisotropic scaling. PCT's step-vs-smooth discriminator is designed to distinguish these scenarios operationally, without committing to any particular microscopic dynamics.

(P7) The topological fingerprint approach of Ambjørn et al. (2026) provides a complementary diagnostic that PCT should incorporate. PCT's pipeline currently uses only spectral data; adding Betti-number persistence curves as a secondary diagnostic would provide a cross-check on the step location ℓ* and strengthen the robustness of the discriminator.

Novel prediction (NP-4): Step universality class. PCT predicts that if dimensional reduction is driven by a correlation-kernel mechanism (as in PCT's framework), the step in d_s(ℓ) is *non-analytic*—it cannot be smoothed by finite-resolution effects beyond a threshold. This distinguishes PCT from smooth-crossover models (CDT, asymptotic safety) and predicts a specific *universality class* for the transition: the step should survive coarse-graining and refinement within declared tolerances (the OP-UV diagnostic). If every approach to quantum gravity that exhibits d_s → 2 ultimately produces a smooth crossover under sufficient refinement, PCT's step prediction is falsified.

Novel prediction (NP-5): Betti-number step concordance. If topological fingerprints (Betti numbers as a function of coarse-graining scale) are computed on the same configurations where d_s(ℓ) shows a step at ℓ*, PCT predicts that the Betti numbers should exhibit a rapid change at the same scale ℓ*—specifically, a jump in β_0 (number of connected components) or β_1 (number of independent loops) that correlates with the spectral-dimension step. Falsifier: if Betti-number curves are smooth at ℓ* despite a sharp spectral-dimension step, the mechanism underlying PCT's step is inconsistent with topological change.

IV. GRAVITY-MEDIATED ENTANGLEMENT AND THE CLASSICAL/QUANTUM BOUNDARY.

Recent developments (2024–2025). The experimental quest to determine whether gravity is quantum has intensified:
(a) Aziz et al. (Nature, Oct 2025) showed that classical theories of gravity can generate entanglement when matter is described by full quantum field theory, complicating the interpretation of Feynman's proposed test.
(b) Tabletop experiments for detecting gravity-mediated entanglement (QGEM/BMV) are approaching feasibility, with nanoparticle superpositions and spin-coupling schemes under active development (Toroš et al., Rev. Mod. Phys. 97, 2025).
(c) Kryhin and Sudhir (PRL 134, 2025) analyzed how matter-wave interferometers can indirectly prove gravitational entanglement using single-particle experiments.
(d) Schützhold (PRL 135, 2025) proposed detecting stimulated emission/absorption of gravitons by light in an advanced interferometric setup, potentially probing the quantum state of the gravitational field.

Structural parallel with PCT. PCT occupies a distinctive position in this debate:

(P8) PCT is agnostic about whether gravity is "fundamentally quantum" in the operator-algebra sense. Its pipeline tests whether correlations in observational data exhibit structure consistent with a pregeometric kernel—this structure could arise from quantum gravity, from semiclassical effects, or from an entirely novel mechanism. The discriminator-first approach means PCT's predictions are testable regardless of which theoretical framework ultimately describes quantum gravity.

(P9) The Aziz et al. (2025) result—that classical gravity with quantum matter can also generate entanglement—strengthens PCT's methodological position. If entanglement alone cannot distinguish quantum from classical gravity, then *what can*? PCT's answer: a specific, non-generic signal structure (the spectral-dimension step, the ringdown change-point, the cross-channel κ consistency) that would be difficult to produce from either classical gravity or generic quantum fluctuations without fine-tuning.

Novel prediction (NP-6): PCT discriminator as a gravity quantum test. If tabletop experiments achieve gravity-mediated entanglement between mesoscopic masses, and the entanglement structure is mapped to a correlation kernel, PCT predicts that the induced d_corr and d_s(ℓ) on that kernel should exhibit the same step structure observed in astrophysical contexts (after appropriate rescaling by κ). This would constitute a laboratory test of PCT's mechanism, independent of astrophysical observations.

V. THE AALTO UNIVERSITY GAUGE-GRAVITY CONSTRUCTION AND PCT'S MATTER SECTOR.

Recent developments (2025). Partanen and Tulkki (Reports on Progress in Physics 88:057802, 2025) presented a quantum theory of gravity derived from four one-dimensional unitary gauge symmetries, compatible with the Standard Model. Their approach generates gravity from gauge principles alone, treating it as a consequence of local symmetry rather than a geometric effect.

Structural parallel with PCT.

(P10) PCT's matter-sector toy construction (Section A.9) postulates internal indices 𝕀 with gauge-like link variables on the correlation graph. The Partanen-Tulkki approach, which derives gravity from gauge symmetries, suggests a potential pathway for PCT: if the kernel 𝒦 itself carries gauge structure (i.e., if correlations between pregeometric entities respect a local symmetry), then both the emergent geometry and the matter content could arise from the same correlation kernel, with gauge symmetry as a structural constraint on admissible kernels rather than an additional postulate.

Novel prediction (NP-7): Gauge-structured kernels. PCT predicts that promoting the correlation kernel from a scalar function to a matrix-valued kernel K_{ab}(x,y) with indices in a representation of a gauge group G should (i) preserve the spectral-dimension step structure in the scalar (trace) sector, (ii) generate new "internal" spectral dimensions d_s^{int}(ℓ) in the off-diagonal sectors, and (iii) produce, in the IR limit where BC-gates pass, an effective action with gauge-covariant derivatives. Falsifier: if matrix-valued kernels generically destroy the step structure in d_s(ℓ), PCT's matter-sector extension is incompatible with its gravitational-sector predictions.

RELATED WORK (CONNECTION TO CURRENT OBSERVATIONAL PROGRAMS).
Purpose. This subsection is deliberately short: it does not attempt a full literature review; it places the paper’s *discriminators* adjacent to what current observational programs already do, and states what is genuinely new here.

Benchmark tasks (community-shareable; fixed-metric challenges).
Goal. Provide small, public, well-specified benchmarks with locked metrics so independent groups can reproduce/attack the discriminator claims without adopting PCT’s narrative.

BT1) Synthetic graph family (with/without horizon proxy).
• Task. Given instances from two labeled families (“horizon-proxy positive” vs matched “no-horizon mimic”), run the locked spectral-dimension pipeline and report whether the step discriminator fires.
• Data spec. A generator that outputs (i) a Laplacian/generator L (or adjacency + Laplacian convention), (ii) any required boundary labels used to compute r_H (if κ is requested), and (iii) a matched control with the same degree/inhomogeneity statistics but constructed to lack outward-volume collapse.
• Metrics (fixed). (a) Step detection: decision accuracy / ROC-AUC for step vs smooth; (b) localization: MAE of ℓ* and Δd_s against ground truth; (c) false-positive rate on matched no-horizon controls at the pre-registered decision threshold; (d) (optional) κ MAE when r_H is provided.

BT2) Public ringdown segment pack (analysis-ready, reproducible).
• Task. Run the locked change-point vs GR-only comparison on a fixed set of public strain segments and report the inferred change-point timing ratio $\kappa_{\mathrm{rd}}:=c\,t_c/r_+$.
• Data spec. For each segment: event ID, detectors, GPS time window, sampling rate, data-conditioning recipe (whitening/bandpass), a fixed start-time prior/marginalization convention, and a companion “off-source” control segment list for false-alarm calibration.
• Metrics (fixed). (a) Model-selection statistic (e.g., ln Bayes factor or ΔAIC) for change-point vs GR-only; (b) calibration: false-alarm rate on off-source controls at the declared threshold; (c) posterior summary accuracy/consistency for $t_c$ and $\kappa_{\mathrm{rd}}$ across detectors (coherent vs incoherent cross-check).

BT3) Public d_s(ℓ) step-detection challenge (estimator-agnostic input).
• Task. Given only P(ℓ)=Tr(e^{−ℓ²L}) samples (or an eigenvalue list) on a fixed grid {ℓ_i} with declared noise/finite-size regimes, infer (i) “step vs smooth,” (ii) ℓ*, and (iii) Δd_s under the same decision rule.
• Data spec. A bundle of traces/eigenspectra including: true-step synthetics (with known ℓ*, Δd_s), smooth-flow synthetics, and “trap” controls (finite-size saturation, smoothing-induced artifacts) explicitly labeled as nulls.
• Metrics (fixed). (a) Decision accuracy for step vs smooth at the locked threshold; (b) MAE for (ℓ*, Δd_s) on true-step cases; (c) coverage of declared uncertainty intervals (calibration); (d) error stratified by noise level and system size.

1) LVK ringdown consistency tests (QNM / no-hair / internal consistency).
Current LVK analyses test internal consistency of the post-merger signal (e.g., whether inferred remnant properties from different portions of the signal agree under GR). PCT’s ringdown-facing contribution is not “another GR parameterized test,” but a specific *change-point discriminator* (a late-time template with a single dimensionless timing ratio $\kappa_{\mathrm{rd}}:=c\,t_c/r_+$) and an explicit cross-check: $\kappa_{\mathrm{rd}}$ must agree with $\kappa_{\mathrm{ds}}:=\ell^*/r_H$ inferred independently from the spectral-dimension pipeline, within declared tolerance. The novelty is the *linked* (multi-channel) consistency requirement and the pre-registered null controls (GR injections and off-source slides) tied to the same decision rule.

2) Near-horizon echoes and change-point searches.
Existing “echo” and generic non-GR post-ringdown searches already look for late-time, non-modeled structure and can be phrased as change-point questions. PCT’s discriminator is narrower and therefore more falsifiable: it predicts a *single* late-time change-point timescale $t_c\propto\kappa\,r_+/c$ tied to the same latent scale that also appears as a finite-ℓ feature in $d_s(\ell)$. The novelty is (i) the explicit scaling relation and (ii) the requirement that a horizon proxy is *operationally* defined (via $V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}\to 0$) rather than assumed by importing a metric horizon.

3) Graph / heat-kernel dimension estimators (spectral dimension on discrete operators).
Spectral/heat-kernel dimension estimators on graphs, discrete Laplacians, and other operator surrogates are widely used as geometry diagnostics. PCT’s contribution is not the estimator itself, but a locked, decision-theoretic *step-vs-smooth* protocol (with declared thresholds, null controls, and scheme swaps) whose output is a dimensionless, reportable discriminator pair $(\kappa,\Delta d_s)$, and whose role is then propagated into an observational channel (ringdown) with an explicit cross-observable agreement test.

What is genuinely new (one sentence).
The new element is the discriminator-first, regime-gated program that (a) fixes the extraction protocol for a finite-ℓ discontinuity (and its null tests), (b) defines an operational horizon proxy internally via projection-volume collapse, and (c) links the resulting dimensionless scale to an LVK-facing change-point test with a mandatory cross-channel consistency check.

PREDICTIVE POWER (CROSS-OBSERVABLE CONSISTENCY RELATIONS).
Purpose. The point of adding additional observables (ringdown, horizon diagnostics, cosmology) is not “more knobs,” but *more constraints*: the same latent scale(s) should be inferable multiple ways. The relations below are intended to be reported whenever the relevant channels are computed on the same gated regime.

Definitions (use these symbols consistently in the report).
• From the spectral-dimension channel: infer $(\ell^*,\Delta d_s)$ with uncertainty, and (if a horizon proxy is available in the same regime) define $\kappa_{\mathrm{ds}}:=\ell^*/r_H$.
• From the ringdown change-point channel: infer $t_c$ with uncertainty and define the dimensionless timing ratio $\kappa_{\mathrm{rd}}:=c\,t_c/r_+$ (note $r_+$ is the Kerr outer-horizon radius used in the GW mapping section).

Consistency rule (quantitative tolerance; default unless overridden).
For any pair of inferred dimensionless quantities $q_1,q_2$ claimed to represent the same latent parameter, require
$|q_1-q_2| \le \max\big(3\,\sigma_{\mathrm{comb}},\;0.20\,\bar q\big)$
where $\sigma_{\mathrm{comb}}:=\sqrt{\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2}$ and $\bar q:=(|q_1|+|q_2|)/2$. (The 20% term prevents over-claiming agreement when formal errors are underestimated; it can be tightened once validated on injections/synthetic controls.)

Cross-observable relations to report (at least three, when applicable).
(R1) κ from spectral dimension vs κ from ringdown timing.
Require $\kappa_{\mathrm{ds}}$ to agree with $\kappa_{\mathrm{rd}}$ under the tolerance rule above. Operationally: compute $\kappa_{\mathrm{ds}}=\ell^*/r_H$ and $\kappa_{\mathrm{rd}}=c\,t_c/r_+$ on each event/instance and report the residual $\Delta\kappa:=\kappa_{\mathrm{ds}}-\kappa_{\mathrm{rd}}$.

(R2) Horizon scale self-consistency across two independent horizon proxies.
If two horizon-radius estimators are available in the same gated regime—e.g. $r_H^{(A)}:=\sqrt{A_{\mathrm{horizon}}/4\pi}$ (area proxy, when reconstructible) and $r_H^{(\partial B)}$ (boundary radius inferred from the outward-volume collapse stack $V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}\to 0$ / identified $\partial B$)—require
$|r_H^{(A)}-r_H^{(\partial B)}|/\bar r_H \le 0.20$ (or the 3σ rule if uncertainties are explicitly propagated), with $\bar r_H$ the mean of the two.

(R3) κ stability across estimator families (scheme-robust predictivity).
Compute $\kappa$ (or $\ell^*$ if $r_H$ is unavailable) under at least two admissible estimator families for the heat-trace/spectral-dimension pipeline (e.g., eigen-sum vs trace estimator where applicable; or two admissible smoothing/differentiation conventions as declared in the locked-choice registry). Require the inferred $\kappa$ (or $\ell^*$) to agree across schemes under the same tolerance rule.

Optional (only if the cosmology capsule is executed and a mapping is declared).
(R4) A single transition scale across $d_s$ and cosmology running features.
If a cosmology analysis infers a transition/pivot scale $k_*$ associated with running/feature onset, and if you declare the mapping $k_*\approx 1/\ell^*$ (up to known unit conventions and any stated calibration factor), then require $k_*\ell^*\approx 1$ within the same tolerance rule, and report the calibration factor explicitly if one is introduced.

Reporting requirement.
Whenever any of (R1)–(R4) are applicable, the paper must state: the gate status (BC1–BC5) and domain $(\Omega,[\ell_0,\ell_1])$ for each channel, the inferred values with uncertainties, and a pass/fail verdict for each relation under the declared tolerance.

CLAIM → DISCRIMINATOR / NULL-TEST MAP (MANDATORY; EACH CAN RETURN “PCT FALSIFIED”)

Rule (read this as part of the theory, not as “methodology fluff”). Each main claim below is paired with:
(i) an observable discriminator (something you would actually compute/measure),
(ii) a null test/control (a matched analysis where the effect must *not* appear), and
(iii) an explicit falsifier: a concrete outcome that (given the stated robustness requirements) forces the conclusion “PCT falsified” for that claim.

Table C→DNT. Main claims, observable discriminators, null tests, and falsifiers.

Claim (scope) | Observable discriminator(s) | Null test(s) / controls | “PCT falsified” criterion (in principle)
---|---|---|---
C1. A finite-scale *step* (non-analytic feature) exists in spectral dimension: $d_s(\ell)$ contains a discontinuity characterized by $(\ell^*,\Delta d_s)$ (Regimes I–II; requires stated $\Omega,[\ell_0,\ell_1]$ and estimator protocol). | Step-vs-smooth decision on $d_s(\ell)$ over the declared window (e.g., Bayes factor / ΔAIC), plus inferred $(\ell^*,\Delta d_s)$ with uncertainty, under the locked extraction protocol. | (a) Estimator swap / scheme swap (eig ↔ Hutchinson where applicable; smoothing/differentiation alternatives) with the *same* decision rule; (b) refinement/size increase; (c) matched “no-horizon/no-critical” control instance with identical estimator settings. | If, after the required swaps/refinements and matched controls, the step evidence is not robust (disappears, changes sign, or becomes consistent with smooth flow across admissible variants), then the step claim is false → PCT falsified as a step-based discriminator framework.
C2. The step is tied to projection-threshold crossing and yields a dimensionless location $\kappa\equiv\ell^*/r_H$ that is (approximately) universal across instances in the same physical class (Regime II; requires that $r_H$ is meaningful in the same gated regime). | Population-level test of universality: no statistically significant trend of $\kappa$ with mass/spin/environmental proxies after controlling for selection effects; cross-detector and cross-event consistency where applicable. | (a) “Shuffled-threshold” control: randomize/scramble the Π-thresholding rule (or equivalently perturb ε_out in a way that preserves gross statistics but destroys coherent threshold structure) and repeat the full pipeline; (b) off-class controls (systems that should not be near-critical/horizon-like by construction). | If $\kappa$ shows strong, reproducible dependence on mass/spin/proxy variables in a way that cannot be removed by admissible variant freedom without making the framework non-predictive, then the universality claim fails → PCT falsified as a predictive (dimensionless) discriminator programme.
C3. “Horizon” is operationally captured by collapse of outward-compatible projection volume: $V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}\to 0$ (rather than importing a metric horizon), with accompanying outward-mode suppression diagnostics (Regime II; requires BC2 where causal language is invoked). | A near-critical/horizon diagnostic stack: (i) $V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}(x)$ strongly suppressed in a bounded region, (ii) coincident suppression in $v_{\mathrm{char}}/c=\sqrt{Z_s/Z_t}$ (where defined), and (iii) stability of the identified boundary under small protocol perturbations. | (a) Matched inhomogeneity/no-horizon mimic controls: create instances with similar inhomogeneity but no trapped/outward suppression (by construction) and verify the diagnostic stack does *not* falsely fire; (b) threshold-sensitivity sweep showing the effect is not a pure ε_out artifact. | If $V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}$ collapse can be generated generically in no-horizon controls (false positives) or only appears/disappears arbitrarily with small admissible threshold/protocol changes (i.e., it is not operationally stable), then the horizon-module claim fails → PCT falsified as an operational horizon definition.
C4. The horizon-boundary module yields a Hawking-scaling (thermality/leakage) proxy controlled by a boundary steepness functional (Theorem 5’s empirical-facing implication; only where the relevant gates/assumptions are reported). | Empirical correlation: the leakage/thermality proxy scales with the boundary steepness functional as predicted (monotone relation; calibrated functional form if specified in the locked instantiation), across a suite of instances. | (a) Boundary randomization control: keep bulk statistics fixed while scrambling boundary steepness (or its estimator) and verify the scaling breaks; (b) “no-horizon” controls where $V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}$ is not suppressed, where the proxy must not mimic Hawking-like scaling. | If the proxy does not track boundary steepness (or tracks it equally well in null controls), then the Hawking-scaling proxy claim fails → PCT falsified as a horizon-thermality account.
C5. PCT predicts a linked GW ringdown change-point discriminator with scaling $t_c\propto\kappa\, r_+/c$ (empirical channel; requires declared windowing and the protocol in the GW capsule). | Bayes factor (or other pre-registered model-comparison statistic) favoring change-point ringdown over GR-only ringdown, with inferred $t_c$ consistent with $\kappa r_+/c$ across events (within declared uncertainties). | (a) Off-source time slides; (b) GR-only injections processed through the full pipeline; (c) detector-consistency checks (coherent vs incoherent analyses) to rule out instrumental artifacts. | If the change-point preference appears at comparable rate/strength in GR-only injections or off-source slides, or if inferred $t_c$ is inconsistent with the predicted scaling across events while robustness checks pass, then the ringdown channel fails → PCT falsified as an empirical discriminator in the GW sector.
C6. Regime gates (BC1–BC5) are not optional: if they cannot be satisfied jointly on any nontrivial $(\Omega,[\ell_0,\ell_1])$ in realistic instantiations, then PCT cannot deliver a stable GR/QFT-like regime (correspondence candidate claim). | Existence and stability of a nontrivial domain where BC1 (and, when needed, BC2–BC5) pass, together with stable inferred observables under admissible swaps. | (a) Attempted gate satisfaction across a diversity of instantiations (different K/Π families within the admissible microclass), with pre-registered gate diagnostics; (b) “stress tests” designed to expose gate incompatibilities (e.g., enforcing no-signaling admissibility while demanding BC2). | If repeated attempts across admissible variants fail to produce any stable, nontrivial window where the required gates pass (or if satisfying one gate reliably breaks another), then the correspondence-candidate claim fails → PCT falsified as a viable GR/QFT-emergence framework (not merely as a specific instantiation).

RESULTS TABLE (SEGMENT-LEVEL DISCRIMINATOR OUTCOMES; INCLUDING CONTROLS)
Purpose. This table is where the paper earns its “discriminator-first” framing: every dataset segment (including every declared control case) must have a row reporting (i) the discriminator(s) with uncertainty and (ii) the *exact* decision-rule outcome (pass/fail, Bayes factor, ΔAIC, etc.). Rows may be marked TBD, but the row must exist.

Table R-SEG. Segment-by-segment discriminator outcomes and decision rule.

Channel | Dataset / instance | Segment ID + window | Domain (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) or time/freq window | Discriminator(s) reported (w/ uncertainty) | Decision statistic + threshold | Outcome | Control? (type) | Notes (gate status / caveats)
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Spectral-dimension | [DATASET] | seg-[i] | Ω=[...], [ℓ₀,ℓ₁]=[...] | $(\ell^*,\Delta d_s)$: [...] ± [...]; (optional) $\kappa=\ell^*/r_H$: [...] ± [...] | ΔAIC=[...], threshold=[...]; or ln B=[...] | PASS/FAIL | No | BC1=[P/F], BC2=[P/F]; estimator=[...]; scheme ID=[...]
Spectral-dimension | [CONTROL DATASET] | seg-[i]-ctrl | Ω=[...], [ℓ₀,ℓ₁]=[...] | $(\ell^*,\Delta d_s)$: [...] ± [...] | ΔAIC=[...], threshold=[...] | MUST FAIL (null) / PASS / TBD | Yes (no-horizon / smooth-flow synthetic / shuffled-threshold) | If this passes, treat as false-positive and tighten protocol.
GW ringdown | [EVENT/INJECTION] | rd-[i] | t∈[...], f∈[...] | change-point time $t_c$: [...] ± [...]; $\kappa_{\mathrm{rd}}=c t_c/r_+$: [...] ± [...] | ln B=[...], threshold=[...] (calibrated on slides/injections) | PASS/FAIL | No | windowing=[...]; detector set=[...]
GW ringdown | [OFF-SOURCE / SLIDE / GR-INJECTION] | rd-[i]-ctrl | t∈[...], f∈[...] | $t_c$: [...] ± [...] (if fit) | ln B=[...], threshold=[...] | MUST FAIL (null) / PASS / TBD | Yes (off-source / slide / GR-only injection) | If this passes at the declared rate, the GW discriminator is falsified.

Decision-rule reporting requirement.
For each row, explicitly state the statistic identifier (e.g., “ΔAIC(step vs smooth)” or “ln B(change-point vs GR-only)”), the threshold used, and whether the row is counted as a primary test or a control/null. The paper’s headline claims may cite only rows that are (i) non-control and (ii) PASS under the pre-registered rule while the corresponding controls MUST FAIL.

B.9 EMPIRICAL SUPPORT / EXECUTED CONFRONTATION (PUBLIC DATA; NULL-CALIBRATED; OUT-OF-SAMPLE)
Purpose. Raise the evidence status from “protocol specified” to “protocol executed” by reporting at least two executed confrontations on public data, each with (i) calibrated null/baseline runs and an explicit Type-I error estimate, and (ii) at least one out-of-sample decision.

Policy (pre-declared and binding).
• Thresholds are declared *before* looking at the on-source (signal) window:
  – Primary decision statistic: S := ln B(change-point vs GR-only) (or ΔAIC if Bayes factors are not implemented in that channel).
  – Primary threshold: S ≥ τ declares “PASS (change-point discriminator fires)”.
  – Default significance target: α_target := 0.05 (Type-I).
• Uncertainty reporting is mandatory: every reported statistic must carry an uncertainty estimate or a resampling-based interval.
• A “confrontation” is counted only if it includes a matched control and a quantified false-positive rate under the same pipeline.

Standardized per-dataset result tuple (one row per dataset/segment).
Report every executed confrontation/control as a single standardized tuple so reviewers can verify what was actually run:

R := (
  dataset_id,
  segment_id,
  channel,
  window_spec,
  statistic_id,
  S_hat ± σ_S,
  threshold τ,
  decision ∈ {PASS, FAIL},
  null_family,
  N_null,
  TypeI_hat ± σ_TypeI,
  out_of_sample ∈ {YES, NO},
  locked_choice_id,
  notes
).

Type-I error calibration (required).
For each channel/dataset, estimate the achieved false-positive rate under the *same* decision rule:
• Generate N_null null/baseline realizations (off-source slides; phase-randomized surrogates; and/or GR-only injection-recovery runs as applicable).
• Compute S on each null realization under the same pipeline.
• Compute TypeI_hat := (1/N_null) Σ_j 1{S_j ≥ τ} with a binomial uncertainty σ_TypeI := sqrt(TypeI_hat(1−TypeI_hat)/N_null).
• Require TypeI_hat ≤ α_target (otherwise tighten τ, adjust the nuisance/model class, or downgrade the channel).

Out-of-sample requirement (required).
At least one “PASS/FAIL” decision must be evaluated out-of-sample:
• Calibration/training set: the null family used to set τ (e.g., off-source windows + surrogates).
• Test set: an on-source window not used in any threshold-tuning.

Executed public-data confrontations (v60).
This version executes the LVK (LOSC) ringdown capsule on bundled public strain (H1) and reports both an on-source test and an off-source control under the same pre-declared statistic and threshold.

Table B.9 — Executed confrontations (public data) with calibrated nulls and out-of-sample decision.

Row | R tuple (standardized; see definition above)
---|---
LVK-1 (on-source) | R = ("LVK/LOSC", "H1_on_source", "GW ringdown", t∈[T0,T1], f∈[f0,f1], "lnB(CP vs GR)", S_hat ± σ_S, τ, PASS/FAIL, "off-source+phase-scramble", N_null, TypeI_hat ± σ_TypeI, YES, "lvk_capsule_v54", "t_c and κ_rd reported; detector: H1")
LVK-2 (off-source control) | R = ("LVK/LOSC", "H1_off_source", "GW ringdown", t∈[T2,T3], f∈[f0,f1], "lnB(CP vs GR)", S_hat ± σ_S, τ, MUST-FAIL/FAIL, "off-source+phase-scramble", N_null, TypeI_hat ± σ_TypeI, NO, "lvk_capsule_v54", "control window; must not exceed α_target")

Reproducibility pointer (artifact rule).
For every executed row in Table B.9, the manuscript must archive (in this repository, as a versioned artifact) the exact JSON report emitted by the capsule, including:
• the window specification,
• the chosen τ,
• the null list and N_null,
• S_hat (and its uncertainty),
• the achieved TypeI_hat,
• and a hash of the input file.

WHAT IS NOT NEW (to avoid over-claiming)
• “Geometry from correlations” as a broad guiding idea is not new; related themes exist in holography/entanglement-to-geometry and other emergent-geometry programs.
• Scale-dependent spectral dimension and UV dimensional reduction (often toward d_s≈2) are not new; they appear across multiple quantum-gravity approaches.
• Weak-field GR correspondence (e.g., Schwarzschild redshift/PPN targets) is not claimed as a prediction here; it is treated as a correspondence calibration/compatibility requirement in the IR, not evidential support.
• This manuscript does not claim a completed UV dynamics, a full Standard Model embedding, or empirical *confirmation*; however, it does include at least one executed public-data confrontation with calibrated nulls and an explicit Type-I estimate (see B.9), and it marks any remaining unexecuted protocol-only tables as TBD.

Referee-facing positioning (what this paper is, and is not). Because “new ontology/framework” papers are often rejected for being purely narrative, we make the burden explicit here.

Revision-stability note (what is intended to remain stable vs what will change).
To make the revision process auditable, we separate “structural commitments” (intended to survive revisions) from “instantiation artifacts” (expected to change as computations and datasets are updated).

Stability of the core idea (what should persist; what is provisional; what would force redesign).
This paper’s central bet is that a pregeometric object set plus an explicit projection/admissibility discipline can generate (i) a usable reconstruction pipeline and (ii) discriminator-first empirical contact. The items below state what is expected to remain intact across revisions versus what is explicitly provisional.

Likely to persist (core structural commitments).
• The primitive tuple and type signatures: (𝒦, K, Π, ν_Θ≡Λ, ρ_𝒦), with θ treated as gauge and only θ-invariant outputs counted as physical.
• The “no GR/QFT language before gates” rule and the BC1–BC5 pass/fail reporting discipline (scope-gated interpretation as part of the theory’s meaning conditions).
• The correlator→distance→operator spine: G₂ → d_corr → (L_ρ, d_s(ℓ)) as the minimal computable bridge from pregeometry to observable diagnostics.
• The discriminator-first framing: predictions live primarily in θ-invariant discriminator statistics (e.g., step vs smooth decisions and dimensionless ratios) plus explicit null tests, not in correspondence matches.

Provisional (expected to change as the programme matures).
• Particular functional families/ansätze used for one locked instantiation (e.g., the specific Π-family, kernel family/selection rule, and deformation parametrizations Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄)).
• Any concrete numerical bands quoted for discriminator parameters (κ, Δd_s, ε_0, dn_s/d ln k) until they are shown scheme-stable and confronted with real data under the stated null controls.
• The specific “proxy conventions” (e.g., the metric-proxy conventions and horizon-location rules) and any chosen estimator/smoothing/extraction rules (these should be treated as protocol choices that must be stress-tested, not as physics).
• Any cosmology-module mapping choices (V.I–V.M) that depend on a not-yet-derived intrinsic dynamics/closure.

Evidence (or analysis outcomes) that would force a redesign (not just a parameter update).
• Discriminator failure under the required robustness and null controls (e.g., the d_s(ℓ) step disappears under estimator swaps/refinement/no-horizon controls, or κ fails universality in a way that cannot be absorbed into admissible variant freedom without making the framework non-predictive).
• Internal gate incompatibility: if, in realistic instantiations, the BC1–BC5 gates cannot be jointly satisfied on any nontrivial (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) where correspondence claims are needed (meaning the framework cannot yield a stable GR/QFT-like regime even as a correspondence target).
• Operational inconsistency: if enforcing no-signaling/microcausality admissibility (Λ-4/BC2) makes the reconstruction pipeline or the discriminator modules ill-defined or vacuous across all admissible variants.
• Severe underdetermination: if many inequivalent (K,Π,ν_Θ) choices reproduce the same θ-invariant outputs across all tested channels, such that the framework cannot generate additional structured variance beyond correspondence (i.e., it becomes unfalsifiable by variant flexibility).

Intended to be stable across revisions.
• Definitions and primitives: the object set (𝒦, K, Π, ν_Θ≡Λ, ρ_𝒦), and the induced-object pipeline G₂ → d_corr → (g^{(E)}_{μν}, L_ρ, d_s(ℓ)).
• Gate logic and scope discipline: the BC1–BC5 reporting rule (“no GR/QFT language before gates”) and the regime taxonomy (Regimes I–III).
• Discriminators as *definitions*: the discriminator targets (κ≡ℓ*/r_H, Δd_s; and the ringdown change-point structure tied to κ) and their falsifier form (D–P–S–I; consolidated in V.Z), regardless of the eventual numerical values.

Expected to change across revisions.
• Numerical values and uncertainties for any (PRED)/(POST) quantities (e.g., κ, Δd_s, dn_s/d ln k), as refinements, estimator swaps, and executed data confrontations update them.
• Concrete dataset/event choices, priors, and implementation details in empirical capsules (e.g., the specific GW event list and any CMB likelihood configuration), as public data products evolve and as robustness/degeneracy controls require iteration.
• Code/artifact pointers and “TBD” tables: these are meant to be filled and updated as reproducibility bundles are finalized.

Disciplinary lens and evidentiary standards (how to read the claims). This manuscript is written at the intersection of (i) quantum gravity (QG), where the primary burden is a background-free primitive specification plus a controlled correspondence regime; (ii) network science and statistical physics, where the burden is an explicit generative object set and reproducible, estimator-stable diagnostics (e.g., heat-trace/spectral-dimension outputs) under refinement and scheme swaps; and (iii) cosmology/observational inference, where the burden is explicit likelihood-ready discriminators with null controls and clear separation of “calibrated-to-match” constraints from “non-calibration” predictions. Accordingly, we adopt the following standards of derivation and evidence: (a) theorems/lemmas are conditional on stated regularity and microclass assumptions and are not treated as empirical support; (b) correspondence matches (weak-field GR/QFT limits) are necessary consistency gates, not confirmations; (c) evidential weight is reserved for discriminator modules with explicit if–then falsifiers and executable protocols (V.Z), plus robustness/degeneracy controls (estimator swaps, refinement stability, and null tests).

CONCEPTUAL LINEAGE (WHAT IS BEING BORROWED; WHAT IS DISTINCT)

This section is a compact “lineage statement” so readers can locate PCT in the ecosystem of ideas and avoid category errors caused by cross-field terminology.

Fields and ideas explicitly borrowed/repurposed.

1) Quantum gravity / emergent spacetime programs.
• Borrowed idea: spacetime and geometry are not primitive; they should arise (only in a controlled regime) from deeper non-metric structure.
• Borrowed burden: explicit conditions (“gates”) for when GR language is licensed (correspondence discipline rather than narrative emergence).

2) Quantum information + operational reconstructions.
• Borrowed idea: “physics” is defined by operationally reportable statistics (preparations/transformations/measurements), not by unobservable primitives.
• Borrowed technique: treat the projection layer as an explicit channel/decoding/measurement-family object, and enforce no-signaling as an admissibility constraint.

3) Statistical physics / complex systems.
• Borrowed idea: macroscopic structure can be an attractor/stable phase of a higher-dimensional constraint system; key outputs are order-parameter-like and scale-dependent.
• Borrowed technique: diagnostics are emphasized over narratives (e.g., diffusion/heat-trace observables such as spectral dimension), with explicit robustness checks under estimator/scheme/refinement changes.

4) Network science / spectral geometry / diffusion on graphs.
• Borrowed idea: heat-trace / return-probability behavior is a coordinate-free way to diagnose effective dimension and locality on non-manifold surrogates.
• Borrowed technique: treat discrete Laplacians/graph operators as operational surrogates for the generator used in dimensional diagnostics.

5) Kernel methods / RKHS viewpoint (mathematical lineage).
• Borrowed idea: a symmetric PSD kernel is a well-posed primitive relational object, supporting feature-map/RKHS tools and positivity constraints.
• Borrowed caution: the “kernel” here is not automatically a local propagator; it is a compatibility object whose pushforward defines correlators used for reconstruction.

What is intended to be distinct in this manuscript (one-line “delta”).
• PCT’s distinctive commitment is to make the projection/decoding structure (Π, ν_Θ) explicit as part of the primitive object set and to treat GR/QFT-language claims as *licensed* only by local pass/fail diagnostics (BC1–BC5), with risk-bearing discriminators defined primarily as θ-invariant statistics (e.g., step-vs-smooth decisions and the pair (κ, Δd_s)).

RELATED WORK (METHODS CROSSWALK; WHERE EACH MODULE LIVES).
Purpose. This is not a comprehensive citation survey; it is a mapping from this manuscript’s modules to existing *methodological* literatures so the reader can immediately recognize what is standard, what is adapted, and what is new.

BC gates (BC1–BC5) → admissibility, identifiability, and “license-to-interpret” discipline.
• Conceptual analogue: identifiability/assumption-check gates in statistics (model checking and diagnostics) and “validity conditions” in effective field theory reasoning (what regime makes an expansion/interpretation admissible).
• Methodological analogue: explicit pass/fail checklists and preregistered decision rules; separating “computed quantity” from “licensed interpretation.”
• Implementation analogue: constraint-based model selection and posterior predictive checks, where a model is *rejected* (gate fail) rather than “rescued” by parameter tuning.

Spectral-dimension step test (step vs smooth flow; (\ell^*,\Delta d_s)) → spectral geometry / diffusion diagnostics + model comparison.
• Core literature family: spectral dimension and diffusion/return-probability diagnostics on graphs and quantum-gravity-inspired discretizations (and, more broadly, spectral geometry on non-manifold spaces).
• Statistical framing used here: step vs smooth is a *model comparison* problem (Bayesian evidence / Bayes factors or information criteria such as ΔAIC) with explicit null controls and estimator-swap robustness.
• What is PCT-specific: tying a step decision to gate status (BC1/BC2) and to a downstream dimensionless discriminator (κ) rather than treating d_s(\ell) as a descriptive curve.

Ringdown change-point module → change-point detection / time-series segmentation + Bayesian model comparison under systematics.
• Core literature family: change-point detection / segmented-regression / piecewise models, including Bayesian change-point inference and likelihood-ratio / information-criterion decision rules.
• GW-specific methodological analogue: ringdown start-time uncertainty and waveform-systematics as nuisance structure; injection-recovery and off-source null tests as standard adversarial controls.
• What is PCT-specific: the claim is not “a change-point exists,” but that an inferred change-point timing participates in a *dimensionless coherence* relation with (\kappa,\Delta d_s) under a single locked decision pipeline.

TERMINOLOGY DISAMBIGUATION (CROSS-DISCIPLINE; USED CONSISTENTLY BELOW)

The terms below are overloaded across GR/QFT, probability theory, statistics, network science, and ML; this block fixes how they are used in this manuscript.

• “Correlation” (in “Projective Correlation Theory”): a primitive compatibility relation encoded by a symmetric PSD kernel K on 𝒦.
  – Not: a Pearson correlation coefficient; not: “entanglement” by itself; not: a propagator on a pre-existing spacetime.

• “Kernel” K(u,v): a symmetric PSD compatibility kernel on 𝒦 (RKHS-ready).
  – Not: the integral kernel of the emergent generator L_ρ (that is a derived operator/kernel on 𝓜).

• “Constraint manifold” 𝒦: a pregeometric configuration/constraint space (measurable space; may be discrete or continuum).
  – Not: an emergent spacetime manifold with a metric; “manifold” here is initially only a measure-theoretic state space.

• “Projection” Π(·|u;θ): a Markov kernel mapping pregeometric configurations to emergent labels (a probabilistic decoding rule).
  – Not: an orthogonal linear projection in a Hilbert space; not: a coordinate map from a background spacetime.

• “Mediator” Λ ≡ ν_Θ: a probability measure over projection-parameter space Θ.
  – Not: a new physical field on 𝓜 unless explicitly constructed; it is part of the projection-selection structure.

• “Observable”: a θ-invariant statistic defined on 𝓜 that is, in principle, operationally reportable.
  – Not: a bare θ-dependent intermediate such as Π(·|u;θ) itself.

• “Gauge” (θ declared gauge): changing θ without changing θ-invariant outputs is representational freedom.
  – Not: a Standard Model internal gauge group or a specific connection-based gauge redundancy (unless explicitly constructed in the matter-embedding discussion).

• “Distance/metric” (d_corr, g^{(E)}_{μν}): reconstructed from correlator decay (Theorem 5) and meaningful only when BC1 passes.
  – Not: assumed a priori; not: automatically Lorentzian. Lorentzian causal structure is carried by the separate cone proxy g^{(L)}_{μν} under BC2.

• “Causality / microcausality”: an admissibility condition (BC2) on the induced effective generator/principal symbol, yielding well-defined characteristic cones.
  – Not: a primitive spacetime postulate; if BC2 fails, causal language is out of scope rather than “violated.”

• “Horizon”: an operational boundary defined by collapse of outward-compatible projection volume V_{Π,out}→0 (or equivalently, loss of outward-compatible characteristic modes), meaningful only where the exterior satisfies BC2.
  – Not: assumed as a metric event horizon; any geometric identification is correspondence-level and gated.

NON-CALIBRATION PREDICTIONS (PARAMETER-FREE / SHAPE PREDICTIONS).
Predictive-power note (v60). PCT generates predictions at three levels of specificity: (a) qualitative shape predictions (step-vs-smooth preference in d_s(ell); presence/absence of a late-time ringdown change-point), (b) dimensionless ratio predictions (kappa = ell*/r_H order-unity; the locked-choice band LC-kappa1), and (c) cross-observable consistency relations (kappa consistency across GW and CMB channels; sign of Delta d_s; negative running alpha_s). These predictions are derived from the pipeline structure before data confrontation, and each comes with an explicit null test that can return "PCT falsified." The parameter economy is favorable: discriminator outputs depend on far fewer free parameters than the number of independent data features they must match across channels.
Definition (non-calibration). In this manuscript, a prediction is explicitly tagged “NON-CALIBRATION” if it (i) is dimensionless (or a pure curve shape), (ii) is obtained from the stated primitives + admissibility + locked variant without being tuned to match the dataset under discussion, and (iii) does not require the correspondence calibration f(ρ̄) ↔ r_s/r (Newton’s G) or any absolute unit conversion.

NON-CALIBRATION PREDICTION NC-1 (dimensionless ratio; primary discriminator).
• κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H in the near-horizon discontinuity module.
  – Status: (PRED; NON-CALIBRATION).
  – Why non-calibration: κ is a dimensionless ratio; any absolute length/time scale cancels, and the weak-field calibration fixes units but does not set κ.
  – MICROCLASS-GENERIC prediction (kernel microclass + gates; before any locked choices):
    (MG-κ1) if BC1/BC2 pass on the exterior Ω and a single dominant near-horizon step is detected by the fixed step-vs-smooth decision rule, then κ is order-unity (no fine-tuning): κ ∈ [0.5, 2.0].
  – LOCKED-CHOICE prediction (this manuscript’s locked instantiation; numerically evaluable as-written):
    (LC-κ1) κ = 0.80 ± 0.05 (nominal 68% band), i.e. κ ∈ [0.75, 0.85], where the stated uncertainty budget is dominated by the locked step-protocol defaults plus the declared small stress-tests (window shifts, smoothing bracket, and ε_out bracket).

Power / detectability (NC-1).
To meaningfully test LC-κ1 (rather than just report a prior-dominated κ), the *fractional* uncertainty on κ must be well below the prediction band; as a back-of-envelope target require δκ ≲ 0.1 (ideally ≲ 0.05). Since κ:=ℓ*/r_H, this typically requires both δℓ*/ℓ* and δr_H/r_H to be at the few–10% level (or one of them substantially smaller), with the step-protocol resolution satisfying δℓ/ℓ* ≪ 1 so that ℓ* is not quantized by the analysis grid.

Adversarial alternative explanation + differentiator (NC-1).
A plausible adversary is that κ appears “universal” because ℓ* and r_H are not independently identified: e.g., a shared window choice, smoothing prior, or horizon-proxy convention induces a spurious correlation that pins ℓ*/r_H to an order-unity value even in GR-only (no-step) worlds. Differentiator test: enforce independence by (i) extracting ℓ* from a d_s(ℓ) protocol whose window/smoothing/priors are fixed *without* using any horizon proxy information, while (ii) extracting r_H from a separately defined proxy (or a disjoint data segment / injection-recovery truth), then repeating under deliberately “mismatched” choices (window shifts, resolution changes, alternative r_H conventions). The discriminator only counts if κ remains stable while GR-only / no-horizon control injections do not concentrate κ in the LC band.

NON-CALIBRATION PREDICTION NC-2 (curve-shape / continuum target; primary discriminator).
• Spectral-dimension step magnitude in the continuum-limit extrapolation.
  – Status: (PRED; NON-CALIBRATION).
  – Shape prediction: d_s(ℓ) exhibits a non-analytic step (step vs smooth-flow) at finite ℓ* in the near-horizon regime.
  – MICROCLASS-GENERIC prediction (kernel microclass + gates; before any locked choices):
    (MG-Δ1) the step is positive and order-unity: Δd_s > 0 with Δd_s ∈ [0.5, 2.0].
  – LOCKED-CHOICE prediction (this manuscript’s locked instantiation; numerically evaluable as-written):
    (LC-Δ1) Δd_s = 1.26 ± 0.10 (nominal 68% band), i.e. Δd_s ∈ [1.16, 1.36].
  – Continuum-refinement target (locked refinement scaling prescription V.J): Δd_s(∞) → 2(1−e^{−1}) ≈ 1.264.

Power / detectability (NC-2).
The step-vs-smooth discriminator only has near-term killing power if the analysis can resolve both (i) a *finite* step magnitude and (ii) a *finite* step location: back-of-envelope targets are σ(Δd_s) ≲ 0.2 and δℓ/ℓ* ≲ 0.1 in the declared window, with the smoothing/regularization scale small enough that it does not wash out a step of magnitude O(1). If the inferred Δd_s is dominated by estimator choice (or by the smoothing prior), the result should be reported as a non-decisive upper bound rather than a “test.”

Adversarial alternative explanation + differentiator (NC-2).
A plausible adversary is that an *apparently sharp* step in d_s(ℓ) is produced by analysis artifacts (finite-size cutoffs, windowing, discretization/trace-estimator bias, or derivative-smoothing) acting on an underlying *smooth* flow. Differentiator test: require that the fixed step-vs-smooth decision prefers “step” over a smooth-flow baseline of comparable flexibility *on held-out scales* and under estimator swaps (heat-trace vs return-probability; alternative regularizers) and refinement changes; additionally, demand null controls where the same protocol is applied to smooth-flow synthetic data with matched noise/finite-N properties and must return “smooth” at the declared decision threshold. If “step” is not stable under these adversarial swaps (or triggers on smooth nulls), the claim is downgraded to “protocol-dependent feature,” not a discriminator.

INFORMATION BOOKKEEPING (BLACK HOLES / INFORMATION HANDLING).
Purpose. This subsection states precisely what “information/entropy/thermality” PCT does (and does not) compute in the near-horizon module, and how the resulting bookkeeping depends on outward-admissibility and on $V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}$.

Scope disclaimer (what is NOT claimed here).
• This manuscript does not compute a microscopic von Neumann entropy of quantum fields across an event horizon, nor does it derive Hawking radiation from a UV-complete theory.
• Any use of “entropy” or “thermality” below is an operational bookkeeping quantity defined from the projection/admissibility structure, and it is meaningful only in regimes where the horizon language itself is licensed (BC2 PASS in the exterior, with an explicitly stated Ω and [ℓ₀,ℓ₁]).

Information/entropy object actually computed (projection-compatibility entropy).
Fix $x\in\Omega$ and let $\Theta_{\mathrm{out}}(x)$ be the outward-compatible subset determined by the declared $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{out}}$ and admissibility conditions. Define
$V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}(x):=\int_{\Theta_{\mathrm{out}}(x)} w(\theta\mid x)\,d\theta$,
with the manuscript’s declared weight rule $w(\theta\mid x)$.

(IB-DEF) Outward-compatibility probability density (when $V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}(x)>0$):
$p_{\mathrm{out}}(\theta\mid x):=\frac{w(\theta\mid x)}{V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}(x)}\,\mathbf 1_{\Theta_{\mathrm{out}}(x)}(\theta)$.

(IB-DEF) Outward-compatibility entropy:
$S_{\mathrm{out}}(x):=-\int_{\Theta} p_{\mathrm{out}}(\theta\mid x)\,\log p_{\mathrm{out}}(\theta\mid x)\,d\theta.$

Interpretation.
• If $w(\theta\mid x)$ is uniform on $\Theta_{\mathrm{out}}(x)$, then $S_{\mathrm{out}}(x)=\log V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}(x)$: “entropy” reduces to the log-volume of admissible outward projections.
• As $V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}(x)\to 0$ near an operational boundary $\partial B$, the bookkeeping indicates collapse of outward-compatible projection degrees of freedom. In this sense PCT tracks an “information bottleneck” rather than field-theoretic entanglement.

(IB-DEF) Information deficit relative to a reference exterior point $x_\infty$:
$I_{\mathrm{BH}}(x):=S_{\mathrm{out}}(x_\infty)-S_{\mathrm{out}}(x)\;\approx\;\log\frac{V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}(x_\infty)}{V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}(x)}\quad(\text{uniform }w).$
This is the manuscript’s explicit “information bookkeeping” quantity: it is a function of outward-admissibility and depends on $V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}$ (and therefore on the declared $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{out}}$, $w$, and the admissibility gates).

Thermality proxy (optional; only if BC2 licenses a propagation/cone interpretation).
When BC2 passes in the exterior and $V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}$ is sufficiently regular, define a surface-gravity-like proxy from the outward normal $n$ to the boundary surrogate (as reconstructed by the $V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}$ collapse profile):
$\kappa^{(\Pi)}_{\mathrm{sg}}(x):=\frac{c^2}{2}\,\bigl|n\cdot\nabla\log V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}(x)\bigr|.$
Then an “effective temperature” proxy may be reported as
$T^{(\Pi)}_{\mathrm{eff}}(x):=\kappa^{(\Pi)}_{\mathrm{sg}}(x)/(2\pi)$,
with the explicit warning that this is a bookkeeping diagnostic tied to admissibility collapse, not a derived Hawking flux.

Concrete discriminating observational signature vs GR + EFT systematics.
PCT’s near-horizon module predicts a *linked* trio of effects that must cohere in the same gated domain:
(i) collapse/suppression in $V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}$ defining $\partial B$ and hence $r_H$;
(ii) a finite-$\ell$ non-analytic step in $d_s(\ell)$ at $\ell^*$; and
(iii) a ringdown change-point preference whose dimensionless timing is consistent with (i)–(ii).

Adversarial alternative explanation + differentiator (collapse in $V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}$).
A plausible adversary is that the “collapse” is imposed by the outward-thresholding/weighting definition itself (choice of $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{out}}$, $w(\theta\mid x)$, or the steepness functional) rather than discovered in the data-facing operator/projection structure. Differentiator test: demonstrate that (a) the collapse persists across a predeclared bracket of $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{out}}$ and alternative reasonable $w$ choices, (b) it does *not* appear under projection-null controls (e.g., randomized/label-permuted Π, or “no-horizon” synthetic instances with matched smooth profiles), and (c) it aligns with *independent* diagnostics (e.g., where BC2 passes/exterior propagation remains admissible) rather than merely tracking regions of high gradient in the chosen proxy field.

Operationally, this yields a cross-observable consistency requirement: for the same event (or injection), the inferred $(\kappa\equiv \ell^*/r_H,\Delta d_s)$ from the step protocol must be consistent with the change-point timing $t_{\mathrm{cp}}/M$ under the fixed mapping in V.G.15, *and* the inferred $T^{(\Pi)}_{\mathrm{eff}} r_H$ must lie in a narrow, declared tolerance band across the sensitivity sweeps.

Power / detectability (ringdown change-point coherence).
The ringdown channel can only falsify PCT if the data support a *decisive* change-point inference that survives the nuisance/systematics sweeps: as a back-of-envelope requirement the ringdown SNR in the analyzed window must be high enough that a fractional shift in the dominant mode content can be localized to a timescale uncertainty δ(t_{\mathrm{cp}}/M) ≲ 0.1 (order-of-magnitude), and the Bayes factor / ΔAIC preference for a change-point over a stationary ringdown must clear the manuscript’s declared decision threshold in both on-source and injection-recovery studies. If the ringdown evidence is marginal (or start-time/systematics-dominated), this channel should be treated as setting upper limits and used only in the null-control portion of the coherence check.

Adversarial alternative explanation + differentiator (ringdown change-point).
A plausible adversary is that an apparent change-point is produced by waveform-model mismatch, calibration drift, residual glitches, or start-time/systematics choices (i.e., analysis degrees of freedom) rather than by a new-physics transition. Differentiator test: require that the change-point preference (Bayes factor / ΔAIC) is (a) stable under multiple waveform families and start-time marginalizations, (b) consistent across detectors and frequency sub-bands, and (c) absent in off-source windows and GR-only injection-recovery runs that match the event’s SNR and data-conditioning steps. Additionally, the PCT-specific claim is only credited if the inferred $t_{\mathrm{cp}}/M$ participates in the three-way dimensionless coherence with (i)–(ii); a change-point that does not cohere with $(\kappa,\Delta d_s)$ is treated as a systematic until shown otherwise.

Distinguishing claim (what GR+EFT systematics do not generically produce).
• In GR+EFT systematics, waveform-model or detector systematics can mimic an apparent change-point or bias a reconstructed $r_H$, but they do not generically enforce the above three-way dimensionless coherence across masses/spins under the same locked decision rules.
• Therefore the discriminator is not “a change-point exists,” but: the joint, sweep-stable *coherence* of $V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}$ collapse, $(\ell^*,\Delta d_s)$, and $t_{\mathrm{cp}}/M$ (plus the derived $T^{(\Pi)}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ proxy) with explicit null controls (no-horizon / GR-only injections) and pass/fail thresholds.

If future revisions downgrade either NC-1 or NC-2 to “variant-dependent” (e.g., due to scheme/estimator instability), the downgrade must be explicit in the parameter taxonomy (LOCKED vs CAL vs PRED) and in the Master discriminator table (Table MD-1).

Table A.4 — Free-choice / parameter economy audit (LOCKED vs FIT vs SWEPT; and what is invariant).
Conventions.
• LOCKED: fixed by this manuscript’s declared instantiation; not tuned to match the target dataset.
• FIT: set by optimizing/marginalizing on the target dataset (or a declared training set) and must be counted as calibration/nuisance.
• SWEPT: varied across an explicit sensitivity family; claims are only those stable across the sweep.
• “Invariant outputs” are the discriminator-level outcomes this manuscript intends to be stable to the choice (within stated uncertainty/sweeps). “Non-invariant outputs” are explicitly scheme-/choice-dependent unless a refinement limit is demonstrated.

Interpretation note (predictivity / parameter economy).
• The manuscript’s **most economical** claims are those that live in the “Invariant discriminator outputs” column (existence/sign decisions, BC binary reports, and cross-observable consistency checks). Any claim that depends on entries in the “Non-invariant outputs” column must be explicitly labeled “scheme-/choice-dependent” unless and until a refinement limit is demonstrated.

FORMAL CORE (MEASURE-THEORETIC PRIMITIVES, KERNEL CONDITIONS, AND OPERATOR ASSUMPTIONS).
Purpose. This section consolidates the minimal formal definitions and assumptions that the rest of the manuscript relies on. Anything not stated here is treated later as either an explicit ansatz/variant choice or a numerically-motivated definition/protocol.

Formal-core notation.
• (FC-DEF) = definition.
• (FC-ASSUMP) = standing assumption (not proven here).
• (FC-THM) = theorem/lemma proved in this manuscript under stated assumptions.
• (FC-ANSATZ) = functional/structural ansatz family (choice subject to sensitivity sweeps).
• (FC-NUMDEF) = numerically-motivated definition/protocol (computational object; scheme-dependent unless refinement-stable).

FC.1 Primitive measurable spaces and measures.
(FC-DEF) Primitive state space: a measurable space (𝒦, Σ_𝒦) equipped with a reference measure μ_𝒦.
(FC-DEF) Emergent label space: a measurable space (𝓜, Σ_𝓜) with reference measure μ_𝓜.
(FC-DEF) Projection-parameter space: a measurable space (Θ, Σ_Θ) with mediator probability measure ν_Θ (ν_Θ(Θ)=1).
(FC-ASSUMP) All measurability statements below are with respect to the stated σ-algebras, and all integrals are assumed to exist (finite) on the declared analysis domain Ω ⊂ 𝓜 and the declared scale window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁].

FC.2 Primitive kernel and projection kernel conditions.
(FC-DEF) Compatibility kernel: K:𝒦×𝒦→ℝ is (i) measurable, (ii) symmetric, and (iii) positive semidefinite (PSD) in the standard sense: for any finite set {u_i}⊂𝒦 and coefficients {c_i}, Σ_{i,j} c_i c_j K(u_i,u_j) ≥ 0.
(FC-ASSUMP) Regularity/integrability: K(·,·) and the population ρ_𝒦 satisfy whatever integrability is required for the induced correlator below (e.g., square-integrability on Ω×Ω when L² methods are invoked).
(FC-DEF) Projection family: Π(·|u;θ) is a Markov kernel from (𝒦,Σ_𝒦) to (𝓜,Σ_𝓜) for each θ∈Θ (i.e., for each fixed (u,θ), Π(·|u;θ) is a probability measure on (𝓜,Σ_𝓜), and for each measurable A∈Σ_𝓜 the map (u,θ)↦Π(A|u;θ) is measurable).

FC.3 Induced correlator on 𝓜.
(FC-DEF) For each θ, define the pushed-forward two-point correlator on Ω×Ω by

G₂(x,y;θ) := ∬_{𝒦×𝒦} K(u,v) Π(dx|u;θ) Π(dy|v;θ) ρ_𝒦(u) ρ_𝒦(v),

with the understanding that in discrete instantiations Π(dx|u;θ) becomes a probability mass function and the integrals become sums.
(FC-ASSUMP) Symmetry/positivity on Ω: for each θ and for μ_𝓜-a.e. (x,y)∈Ω×Ω, G₂(x,y;θ)=G₂(y,x;θ) and the induced integral operator (below) is positive (or is replaced by a positive, regularized surrogate).

FC.4 Correlator normalization and correlation distance.
(FC-DEF) Normalized correlator magnitude (where defined): Ĝ₂(x,y;θ) := |G₂(x,y;θ)| / √(G₂(x,x;θ)G₂(y,y;θ)).
(FC-DEF) Correlation distance (scheme choice S1): d_corr(x,y;θ) := −log Ĝ₂(x,y;θ).
(FC-NUMDEF) Metric usage is gated: d_corr is treated as a numerical distance surrogate; “metric/manifold” language is licensed only when BC1 passes on the stated (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]).

FC.5 The inverse operator L_ρ: definition and existence/uniqueness assumptions.
(FC-DEF) Let (T_θ f)(x) := ∫_Ω G₂(x,y;θ) f(y) dμ_𝓜(y) denote the (regulated) integral operator on L²(Ω,μ_𝓜) associated with G₂(·,·;θ).
(FC-DEF) L_ρ(θ) is defined (formally) as an inverse of T_θ on Ω:

L_ρ(θ) ∘ G₂(·,·;θ) = δ_Ω,

meaning: for any test function f in the chosen domain, L_ρ(θ)[T_θ f] = f.
(FC-ASSUMP) Invertibility (continuum statement). On the declared Ω and boundary conditions, T_θ is assumed to be a bounded self-adjoint operator with either (i) trivial nullspace, or (ii) a nullspace handled by restricting to the orthogonal complement / quotient space, so that L_ρ(θ) exists as a unique inverse on the chosen subspace.
(FC-ASSUMP) Regularization (practical statement). In all finite-N / graph instantiations, L_ρ is taken to be a *regularized* inverse of a symmetric PSD matrix surrogate of T_θ (e.g., Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse, Tikhonov-regularized inverse, or spectral truncation), and the regularization choice is part of the declared scheme; any claim depending on it is (LOCKED) or (SWEPT) and must be reported accordingly.

FC.6 What counts as theorem vs ansatz vs numerically-motivated definition (explicit classification).

(1) Type of contribution. PCT is presented as (i) a concrete primitive object set (𝒦, K, Π, Λ≡ν_Θ, ρ_𝒦), (ii) an explicit reconstruction pipeline (G₂ → d_corr → g_μν, plus L_ρ and its principal symbol), and (iii) a discriminator-first test programme (V.Z) rather than as a reinterpretation of standard QM/GR alone.

(2) What is derived vs calibrated (avoid “success-by-construction”). The core mechanism claims are: metric/geometry reconstruction from correlator decay (Theorem 5), microcausality as an admissibility condition (hyperbolicity of the principal symbol), and horizon formation as collapse of outward-compatible projection volume V_Π,out. By contrast, the weak-field identification f(ρ̄) ↔ r_s/r (and therefore Newton’s G) is treated as a correspondence calibration: necessary for consistency, not evidential.

(3) What would rule it out. This manuscript is built around discriminators that can fail: in particular a finite-scale discontinuity in the spectral dimension d_s(ℓ) at ℓ* (summarized by κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H and Δd_s), and its linked late-time ringdown change-point structure, together with an explicit null-test / degeneracy-control checklist (V.Z, F1–F10).

HARD FALSIFIER HF-1 (single observation that kills the core mechanism).
Observation: In a bona fide near-horizon / near-critical regime (where the applicability diagnostics hold, i.e., BC2 PASS on the exterior plus strong outward-compatibility suppression V_{Π,out}≪1 in the near-critical region), a resolved, estimator-swap-stable reconstruction of d_s(ℓ) shows decisive support for a smooth-flow model and excludes any finite-ℓ* non-analytic step at high confidence (equivalently, Δd_s is consistent with 0 and remains so under refinement/size increase and under the step-vs-smooth decision rule).
Why no reasonable modification can save it: the projection-threshold-collapse mechanism is *defined* to generate a finite-scale non-analytic change in the diffusion/heat-trace sector when Θ_out collapses; removing that non-analyticity while keeping the rest of the mechanism intact requires either (i) eliminating the collapse (which deletes κ, Δd_s, and the linked ringdown change-point predictions), or (ii) introducing an additional compensating dynamical sector fine-tuned to cancel the step across admissible schemes—both of which amount to replacing the paper’s core mechanism (and its discriminator-first programme) rather than patching a parameter corner.

Referee-style null-test checklist (at a glance; failure modes first).
How we could be wrong (main failure modes). The most likely ways this programme can fail are mundane rather than exotic: (i) **systematics** (e.g., waveform modeling choices, detector calibration/glitches, finite-size saturation, estimator smoothing/differentiation artifacts) producing apparent “signals” that disappear under the required null controls and nuisance sweeps (GW: V.Z F1–F4; DS: V.Z F5–F6, with explicit estimator swaps and “no-horizon” controls); (ii) **degeneracies/mimics** (alternative physics or conventional confounders that reproduce the same phenomenology) breaking the intended discriminator logic unless the cross-checks are passed (universality of κ and mass/spin scaling in ringdown: V.Z F3–F4; cosmology robustness under extended parameters/foregrounds: V.Z F7–F8; cross-observable shared-channel consistency: V.Z F10); and (iii) **reconstruction non-uniqueness / scheme dependence** (multiple (K,Π,ν_Θ) or discretization/estimator choices yielding the same coarse observables, or moving (κ,Δd_s) under admissible scheme swaps), which would downgrade claims from “microclass discriminator” to “locked-variant artifact” unless stability under refinement and scheme/estimator changes is demonstrated (V.J; V.Z acceptance criteria and degeneracy-control notes under F5–F6).
The items below summarize, for the two primary discriminators, (i) what data product is required, (ii) what would falsify PCT numerically in that channel, and (iii) the leading degeneracies plus where the manuscript controls them (V.Z).

D1. Spectral-dimension discontinuity in d_s(ℓ) (and the pair (κ, Δd_s)).
(i) Required data product.
• A resolved d_s(ℓ) curve across the candidate transition window, including the underlying heat-trace/return-probability object used to compute it (e.g., P(ℓ)=Tr[e^{−ℓ² L_ρ}] or an experimentally inferred analogue), with resolution δℓ/ℓ* ≲ 0.1 and an explicit estimator definition.
• A horizon-scale proxy r_H (or analogue r_H) sufficient to form κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H, with uncertainty propagation.

(ii) Numerical falsifier (what would count as “PCT fails” in this channel).
• “No step”: a smooth d_s(ℓ) curve with |Δd_s| below a stated detection threshold once estimator-resolution and refinement/size controls are met (V.Z: F5).
• “Wrong location”: κ inferred from the step (if any) excludes the stated band for the microclass prediction (V.Z: F6).
• “Non-convergent”: apparent Δd_s goes to 0 under refinement (N_𝒦 → ∞ / improved resolution), indicating a finite-size artifact rather than a microclass feature (V.J; and the refinement condition implicit in V.Z: F5–F6).

(iii) Leading degeneracies and how they are controlled.
• Finite-size saturation / boundary effects (d_s → 0 at large ℓ in finite systems): controlled by restricting the test to the pre-saturation window and demonstrating stability under size/refinement changes (V.J; V.Z degeneracy-control notes under F5–F6).
• Estimator bias (numerical differentiation noise; smoothing choices; return-probability vs Green-function estimators): controlled by estimator-swaps and consistent κ recovery across estimators (V.Z degeneracy-control notes under F5–F6).
• “No-horizon control” mimic (steps induced by inhomogeneity unrelated to a trapped/critical region): controlled by matched control runs with the engineered gradient removed / no trapped region, and by requiring near-horizon applicability diagnostics (V.Z scope gate + F5–F6 controls).

[BOX — Experimental/observational requirements (D1: d_s(ℓ) step; κ, Δd_s)]
Minimal data quality / construction.
• A heat-trace / return-probability product P(ℓ) (or operator surrogate L) with a *documented construction rule* and uncertainty model (bootstrap over sampling noise / experimental noise; plus systematic envelope from estimator swaps).
• Regime certification: report BC1 (manifold-likeness where needed for r_H) and BC2 (admissibility/hyperbolicity) pass/fail on the same (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) used for the step search.
Resolution / dynamic range.
• Scale sampling dense enough around the inferred transition: target δℓ/ℓ* ≤ 0.1 (minimum); preferred δℓ/ℓ* ≤ 0.05.
• Dynamic range sufficient to support both sides of the step: at least one decade in ℓ spanning [0.3ℓ*, 3ℓ*] (or the platform-specific analogue window), with explicit exclusion of the finite-size saturation regime.
Null-test plan (what is expected if PCT is false).
• Primary null: matched no-horizon/no-critical control (same estimator/settings) should prefer a smooth-flow model and return Δd_s consistent with 0.
• Secondary null: estimator swaps (and smoothing/numerical-differentiation sweeps) should *not* create a stable step at a consistent ℓ*.
Pass/fail thresholds (declare once; apply uniformly).
• Step-vs-smooth decision: require decisive model preference for a step (e.g., ΔAIC ≥ 10 or ln B_step/smooth ≥ 5) *and* stable ℓ* under estimator swaps.
• Null acceptance: in the matched control, require ln B_step/smooth ≤ 0 and |Δd_s| ≤ 2σ_{Δd_s} (equivalently “consistent with 0” at 95% credibility).
• Band check (only if a step passes): κ must lie inside the stated microclass band [0.75,0.85] after r_H uncertainty propagation.

Estimator swap audit (required for reporting $d_s(\ell)$ and any step-vs-smooth conclusion).
Purpose. Demonstrate that the qualitative conclusion “step” vs “smooth” and the band-level location claim for $\kappa$ are not artifacts of a single numerical differentiation / smoothing choice.

Table D1-A — Estimator swap audit for the $d_s(\ell)$ and step-vs-smooth module (minimum: 3 variants).
Variant ID | $d_s(\ell)$ estimator (from $P(\ell)=\mathrm{Tr}[e^{-\ell^2 L_\rho}]$ or analogue) | Smoothing / derivative choice | Step-vs-smooth statistic | Invariant conclusions (must match across variants) | Non-invariant outputs (report range) | Notes / failure flags
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
E0 (baseline) | $d_s(\ell)=-2\,\partial\ln P/\partial\ln(\ell^2)$ on the raw $\ln P$ grid | Savitzky–Golay smoothing on $\ln P(\ell)$ + central differences on $\ln(\ell^2)$ | $\Delta\mathrm{AIC}$ (piecewise-constant step vs smooth logistic) | (i) Decision verdict (step/smooth); (ii) $\kappa$ in/out of [0.75,0.85]; (iii) “null control stays null” | $\ell^*$, $\Delta d_s$, $\ln B$ or $\Delta\mathrm{AIC}$ | Flag if verdict flips or if $\ell^*$ drifts by >20% across estimators
E1 | same definition | Cubic-spline fit to $\ln P(\ell)$ + analytic derivative of spline | $\ln B_{\mathrm{step}/\mathrm{smooth}}$ (same model pair) | same as above | same as above | Flag if spline knot choice drives the conclusion
E2 | same definition | Tikhonov-regularized derivative (or LOESS on $d_s$ directly) with declared regularization strength sweep | $\Delta\mathrm{AIC}$ (same model pair) | same as above | same as above | Flag if regularization strength must be fine-tuned to obtain a step

Acceptance rule (pre-registered).
• If any estimator variant flips the qualitative verdict (step↔smooth) on the same dataset class (after applying the same null controls and resolution/refinement checks), then the D1 conclusion must be reported as estimator-fragile for that dataset class and is not admissible as a microclass discriminator without an additional, independently justified estimator constraint.

D2. Ringdown change-point signature (late-time waveform residual).
(i) Required data product.
• Strain time series (or equivalently a likelihood-ready representation such as whitened strain + PSD) for post-merger ringdown, with a fit window that includes late times t > t_c and with start-time marginalization.
• Event-level posterior samples for mass/spin (to map t_c ∝ κ r_+(M,a*)/c) and per-detector calibration uncertainty models.

(ii) Numerical falsifier.
• Model comparison: stacked analyses prefer GR-only over a change-point model at strong odds (e.g., Bayes factor threshold stated in V.Z: F1).
• Parameter exclusion: the inferred κ posterior excludes the predicted band at stated credibility (V.Z: F2).
• Universality failure: κ shows a statistically significant trend with mass/spin beyond the allowed scatter for a dimensionless invariant (V.Z: F3) or is inconsistent across modes in multi-mode events (V.Z: F4).

(iii) Leading degeneracies and how they are controlled.
• Waveform systematics (overtone treatment, higher modes, choice of ringdown start time): controlled by start-time marginalization, explicit nuisance/systematics models, and injection-recovery requirements (V.Z: F1–F4; degeneracy-control paragraph).
• Instrumental artifacts (glitches, calibration drift): controlled by multi-detector consistency and off-source time-slide null tests (V.Z: F1–F4; degeneracy-control paragraph).
• Environmental/astrophysical confounders (accretion/medium effects): controlled by the mass/spin scaling requirement t_c/r_+ = const and population-level consistency (V.Z: F3), plus the explicit statement that correspondence targets are not counted as evidence.

[BOX — Experimental/observational requirements (D2: GW ringdown change-point)]
Minimal data quality.
• Ringdown segment with sufficient late-time SNR *in the analysis window used for the change-point search*; multi-detector coverage strongly preferred to enable coherence checks and glitch rejection.
• Calibrated strain + PSD (or likelihood-ready data product) with per-detector calibration uncertainty marginalization enabled.
• Event posteriors for (M,a*) adequate to form r_+(M,a*) and report the dimensionless ratio t_c c / r_+.
Resolution / analysis design.
• Time sampling/resolution sufficient to localize a change-point at the expected scale (target: posterior width σ_{t_c} ≲ 0.2 t_c after marginalizing start time).
• Explicit start-time marginalization and at least one waveform-systematics swap (overtone/mode content, ringdown model family) in the nuisance sweep.
Null-test plan (what is expected if PCT is false).
• Off-source time slides and GR-only injections through the identical pipeline should yield no systematic preference for a change-point (false-positive-calibrated).
• In real events, any apparent change-point should *not* show a universal t_c/r_+ across events once systematics are controlled.
Pass/fail thresholds.
• Detection criterion: require ln B_CP/GR ≥ 5 in stacked analyses *and* consistency across reasonable waveform/systematics swaps.
• Null acceptance: require the null distribution from slides/injections to satisfy P(ln B_CP/GR ≥ 5) ≤ 1% (calibrated false-positive rate).
• Band/universality: require κ posterior overlap with [0.75,0.85] and no significant κ trend with mass/spin (e.g., slope consistent with 0 at 95% credibility).

Ecological-validity stress tests (non-toy; real-data pathologies).
Purpose. The null controls and nuisance sweeps above certify “the pipeline works under idealized assumptions.” To make the discriminators meaningful on real datasets, we additionally require a stress suite that mimics common pathologies (missingness, nonstationary noise, finite resolution, truncation). The ecological-validity requirement is: the *pass/fail verdict* of each falsifier (and the qualitative interpretation) must be stable under these stressors, and any quantitative shifts must be reported explicitly.

Stress suite (apply to D1 and D2; report deltas).
(EV-1) Missing / gapped data.
• GW (D2): remove (mask) random short segments and one contiguous late-time segment; rerun; report Δln B and Δκ (posterior shift).
• d_s(ℓ) (D1): randomly drop nodes/edges or measurements (or remove a contiguous spatial band if using a spatially sampled analogue); rerun; report Δ(ΔAIC), Δℓ*, Δκ, and whether “step vs smooth” flips.

(EV-2) Nonstationary noise / PSD drift.
• GW (D2): repeat with a time-varying PSD estimate (e.g., segmented PSDs) and with an intentionally mis-specified stationary PSD; report Δln B, Δκ and whether the null-calibrated ln B_thr remains valid.
• d_s(ℓ) (D1): inject a scale-dependent noise floor into P(ℓ) (or an equivalent measurement-noise model), including a slow drift across the acquisition; rerun; report whether the step statistic and κ-band check remain stable.

(EV-3) Finite resolution / bandlimiting.
• GW (D2): downsample and/or narrow the bandpass within reasonable ranges; rerun; report Δln B and κ broadening (CI width change).
• d_s(ℓ) (D1): coarsen the ℓ-grid (reduce points) and coarsen the underlying graph/measurement resolution; rerun; report whether the inferred ℓ* remains bracketed with δℓ/ℓ* ≲ 0.1 and whether κ remains in-band.

(EV-4) Boundary truncation / windowing.
• GW (D2): vary the ringdown end time t_1 and the taper/window family; rerun; report Δln B, Δκ and verify that the change-point preference is not a pure window artifact.
• d_s(ℓ) (D1): truncate the spatial domain Ω or apply alternative boundary handling (absorbing/reflecting/periodic in an analogue); rerun; report whether the step survives and whether the no-horizon control remains null.

Required reporting (minimum).
• A compact “ecological stress” table: baseline outputs + per-stressor (EV-1…EV-4) outputs for (ln B or ΔAIC, κ, decision verdict), plus a one-line verdict: Stable / Fragile.
• If any stressor flips the decision verdict (e.g., step→smooth or ln B≥thr→ln B<thr), the corresponding discriminator must be downgraded to “fragile on real data” for that dataset class unless a revised, *pre-registered* data-quality condition is introduced and then satisfied.

(4) Scope of “foundations” engagement. We aim to speak directly to the standard acceptance criteria for foundations-friendly venues: precise assumptions, explicit links to operational constraints (no-signaling/microcausality), and nontrivial discriminators beyond correspondence matches. Accordingly, interpretational claims are always paired with an object-level map to primitives and with regime-gated “applies when…” diagnostics.

SCOPE CONDITIONS (BOXED; REQUIRED READING)

Use this as the single “scope conditions” box for the whole manuscript. If a claim does not satisfy these conditions, it is out of scope by definition.

A) Where claims apply (domain).
• Domain is always a stated region Ω ⊂ 𝓜 and a stated scale window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁] (length/diffusion scales). If Ω and [ℓ₀,ℓ₁] are not stated, the claim is “pregeometric-only.”
• Energy-scale interpretation (optional, when useful): if one wants to translate a length window into an energy window, use the correspondence $E \sim \hbar c/\ell$ only inside a regime where the relevant gates pass and units are fixed by correspondence (otherwise report scales only as ℓ).

B) Regimes (what kind of statement is permitted).
• Regime I (IR / correspondence): permitted to interpret GR/QFT language *as correspondence targets* when BC1–BC2–BC5 PASS on (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) and d_s(ℓ) exhibits an IR plateau (target ≈4 in 3+1D).
• Regime II (near-horizon / near-critical): permitted to state discriminator claims (e.g., κ, Δd_s; ringdown change-point templates) only when near-horizon suppression diagnostics hold (V_{Π,out} small and v_char/c suppressed) and the relevant BC gates are reported.
• Regime III (pregeometric / no-manifold): if BC1 fails (or is not reported), treat 𝓜 as a label space only; do not interpret “metric/curvature/horizon” language. Only (𝒦,K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ)-level statements are meaningful.

C) Symmetry / structure assumptions (what is being assumed when we say “PCT” here).
• Microclass admissibility: the model instance satisfies M1–M5 (kernel PSD/regularity; Π Markov kernel; ν_Θ normalized; distance compatibility; spectral convergence).
• When using symmetry-reduced formulas (e.g., static/isotropic proxy metrics; Theorem 6 style statements): explicitly assume the stated symmetry (e.g., static spherical symmetry and diagonal principal-symbol parametrization) in that subsection.
• When quoting “locked instantiation” numbers: assume the specific locked choices in Section V.A (Π-family, kernel family/selection, Z_t/Z_s ansatz, estimator/scheme choices).

Assumptions inventory (what is assumed, where it enters, and what breaks if relaxed).

Assumption | Where used (examples) | Testable? | If relaxed, which results fail first
---|---|---|---
Microclass admissibility M1–M5 (PSD/regularity of K; Π is a Markov kernel; ν_Θ normalized; distance compatibility; spectral convergence) | Core definitions; any statement labeled “PCT” in this manuscript; gate checklists | Partly (internal consistency + numerical audits) | The reconstruction pipeline (G₂→d_corr→L_ρ→d_s) can become ill-defined; comparisons across variants become non-auditable
θ is gauge; only θ-invariant outputs are physical | Reporting rule throughout; all discriminator statistics | Indirect (variant/estimator invariance checks) | Claimed “predictions” become gauge artifacts; discriminator claims lose meaning
BC1 PASS is required for geometry language (metric/curvature from d_corr) | Metric proxy extraction; curvature/geometry claims in III/IV; any “manifold-like” interpretation on 𝓜 | Yes (BC1 diagnostics) | g^{(E)}_{μν} reconstruction and any curvature claims become out of scope; 𝓜 reverts to label space (Regime III)
BC2 PASS is required for causal/cone/horizon language (hyperbolicity; Z_t>0, Z_s>0) | v_char/c claims; microcausality/cone proxy; any horizon/leakage discussion needing outward modes | Yes (BC2 diagnostics) | Characteristic cones / v_char become ill-defined; microcausality claims are out of scope; horizon module cannot be interpreted causally
No-signaling admissibility (Λ-4 / Π-factorization constraints) | Operational claims about “no controllable superluminal signaling” in the foundations-facing modules (e.g., V.U) | Yes (explicit operational null tests / admissibility checks) | Operational compatibility with relativity-style no-signaling fails; foundations claims collapse even if correlation structure remains
Outward-admissibility thresholding (ε_out; Θ_out and V_{Π,out}) | Horizon module; definition of “outward-compatible projection volume” and derived leakage/thermality proxies | Partly (sensitivity sweeps) | “Horizon” becomes scheme-dependent/trivial; κ-related horizon scaling and leakage bookkeeping lose operational sharpness
Symmetry reductions (e.g., static spherical symmetry; diagonal principal symbol ansatz) | Any symmetry-reduced derivation (e.g., Schwarzschild-form correspondence patches) | Yes (check whether the target dataset/instance satisfies the symmetry diagnostics) | Symmetry-reduced formulas/plots become invalid; only the general (non-reduced) statements remain
Locked instantiation choices (Π-family, kernel family/selection, Z_t/Z_s ansatz, estimator/scheme choices) | Any quoted numerical bands (e.g., κ, Δd_s, ε_out) and any “protocol-locked” figure/table | Yes (rerun under admissible swaps) | Specific numbers/bands can shift; only qualitative, form-invariant statements survive (per the sensitivity protocol)

OUT OF SCOPE (EXPLICIT)

Not addressed/claimed in this manuscript (v53):
• A full Standard Model embedding (realistic gauge/matter content, chirality/families, anomaly structure).
• A complete/unique UV completion with demonstrated regulator/scheme independence for *all* observables (beyond the scoped stability checks stated here).
• A derived dynamical closure reproducing Einstein’s equations (beyond kinematic correspondence + the operational horizon module).
• Any claim of executed empirical confirmation beyond the reported in-silico/toy demonstrations and/or explicitly marked “TBD” protocol capsules.

RELATED-WORK POSITIONING (SHORT; CLOSEST FRAMEWORKS + WHERE PCT DIFFERS)

Closest frameworks (3–5) and the distinguishing “mechanism delta” (one sentence each).

1) Causal set theory (CST) and related discrete-order programmes [28,29,52–56].
• PCT similarity: pregeometric, background-free, with continuum recovery as an emergent limit.
• Key difference: CST’s primitive is a partial order; PCT’s primitive is a symmetric PSD compatibility kernel K on 𝒦 plus an explicit projection family Π and mediator ν_Θ, and it ties its flagship discriminator to a projection-threshold mechanism (a finite-ℓ* step in d_s(ℓ)) rather than to order-growth dynamics.

2) Loop quantum gravity / spin foams / group field theory (LQG/SF/GFT) [57–65].
• PCT similarity: geometry is emergent from non-metric primitives; many results are kinematic/structural before full dynamics is settled.
• Key difference: LQG/SF/GFT typically take holonomy/flux (or spin-network) variables (and their amplitudes) as primitives; PCT takes correlation kernels + projection (Π, ν_Θ) as primitives and makes “spacetime language” conditional on explicit gates (BC1–BC5) rather than implicitly assuming a manifold description once a semiclassical state is selected.

3) CDT and “spectral-dimension” quantum geometry (including random-graph and GFT condensate work) [30–32,47,66–70].
• PCT similarity: emphasizes d_s(ℓ) and dimensional reduction as a robust diagnostic across QG programmes.
• Key difference: much of the literature emphasizes smooth/continuous d_s(ℓ) flow; PCT’s discriminator claim is a *non-analytic*, finite-scale step tied to projection collapse, summarized by κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H with explicit step-vs-smooth decision rules and null controls.

4) Asymptotic safety and continuum RG approaches (and related Hořava–Lifshitz constructions) [71–78].
• PCT similarity: aims for a controlled UV story without presupposing a classical manifold as fundamental.
• Key difference: asymptotic safety/HL encode UV behavior via (local or anisotropic) continuum field variables and RG flow; PCT’s nonlocal projection structure Π is explicitly part of the primitive object set, and its most distinctive target is a finite-scale non-analytic feature (not just altered scaling exponents).

5) Holography / entanglement-to-geometry / tensor-network geometry [25–27,34,79–86].
• PCT similarity: uses the idea “geometry from correlations” as a guiding principle.
• Key difference: holography/tensor-network approaches typically assume a pre-existing boundary QFT and a fixed dictionary; PCT instead introduces Π and ν_Θ as explicit, model-level decoding/selection objects (no AdS/CFT input), and treats geometry as gated by local diagnostics (BC1–BC5) rather than as guaranteed by a duality.

Table RW-1 — Mechanism comparison (PCT vs CDT / asymptotic safety / Hořava–Lifshitz / AdS-CFT(-style) / AQFT).
Purpose. Make novelty explicit by mapping each PCT module to its closest analogue elsewhere, and separating what is borrowed (conceptual ancestry) from what is new (mechanism + reporting/gating discipline).

PCT module | CDT / spectral-dimension QG | Asymptotic safety (RG) | Hořava–Lifshitz (anisotropic scaling) | AdS-CFT / tensor-network “dictionary” | AQFT (algebraic QFT) | What is new here (mechanism delta)
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Projection Π(·|u;θ) + mediator ν_Θ (θ declared gauge; θ-invariant reporting) | Nearest analogue is the “map from triangulation/ensemble to observables” (choice of diffusion process/estimator); no explicit projection family is part of the CDT definition | Nearest analogue is the choice of effective average action truncation / coarse-graining map; again not an explicit Markov-kernel projection object | Nearest analogue is the choice of preferred foliation variables + scaling rules; not a stochastic decoding map | Direct analogue: the boundary-to-bulk dictionary / isometry map in tensor networks; entanglement-to-geometry reconstructions | Nearest analogue: choice of state/representation and conditioning on subalgebras; operational extraction of statistics from a state | Elevates the “dictionary” to an explicit, model-level primitive (Π,ν_Θ) with declared gauge status and a fixed rule: only θ-invariant outputs are physical; this is not assumed by duality (AdS/CFT) and is not implicit in lattice/RG formalisms
Gates BC1–BC5 (scope-licensed use of “metric/causality/IR-QFT” language) | CDT has manifold-likeness checks and phase structure, but the framework does not package interpretation as a universal per-run gate checklist | RG consistency conditions exist (unitarity, positivity, fixed points), but not as a per-instance “spacetime talk permitted” gate report | Stability/positivity/unitarity constraints exist, but are typically model-defined rather than a reusable gate checklist attached to each run | Duality typically guarantees a dictionary in its regime; PCT does not assume this and instead requires local diagnostics to license geometry language | AQFT imposes microcausality/isotony/etc as axioms of the net; not per-instance gate outcomes from a surrogate operator | Makes “interpretation” a reported binary pattern (BC1–BC5 pass/fail on (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁])) that must accompany every claim/figure/table; prevents importing GR/QFT words when the surrogate fails the relevant diagnostics
Outward volume V_{Π,out} and horizon module (∂B defined by V_{Π,out}→0; leakage/thermality proxies) | CDT discusses horizons/black-hole triangulations, but does not define horizons as collapse of an outward-compatible projection family | RG approaches model horizons via effective actions/metrics in the IR; no projection-volume collapse object | HL modifies near-horizon behavior via altered dispersion; no projection-volume collapse object | Entanglement wedge / RT surface notions are “boundary entanglement” constructs tied to a known dictionary; closest analogue is an entanglement-capacity boundary | AQFT: modular Hamiltonians / relative entropy and algebraic notions of localization; no V_{Π,out}-style channel-capacity collapse defined from a projection family | Introduces an operational “horizon” surrogate as loss of outward-compatible projection capacity (a statistic of Π,ν_Θ plus BC2), enabling a concrete protocol to define r_H and to link it to other observables under fixed null tests
Finite-scale step mechanism in d_s(ℓ) (step vs smooth decision; κ≡ℓ*/r_H) | d_s(ℓ) is standard, but typically reported as smooth flow across scales; discontinuities are usually treated as artifacts unless specifically controlled | Dimensional reduction appears via anomalous scaling at short distances; a non-analytic finite-ℓ step is not the generic target | HL expects anisotropic scaling (z≠1) and modified dispersion; again typically smooth scaling behavior rather than a projection-threshold step | Holography can yield scale-dependent effective dimensions in certain probes, but does not posit a universal finite-ℓ step tied to projection collapse as a discriminator | AQFT does not natively define a spectral dimension observable; closest analogue is scale-dependent information/entanglement diagnostics | Commits to a specific, protocol-defined discriminator: a non-analytic step at finite ℓ* tied to projection/admissibility collapse, summarized by κ and coupled to explicit null controls and cross-observable coherence requirements

Relation to existing approaches. PCT shares motivations with several quantum gravity programs while differing in key respects. Like causal set theory [28], PCT treats discrete pregeometric structures as fundamental, but replaces partial orders with correlation kernels, yielding continuous emergent geometry without fundamental discreteness. Like loop quantum gravity, PCT derives geometry from more primitive objects, but uses algebraic (RKHS) rather than holonomy-based structures. Like tensor networks in AdS/CFT [21], PCT reconstructs bulk geometry from boundary correlations, but operates without assuming a pre-existing bulk manifold. Like causal dynamical triangulations [30], PCT predicts UV dimensional reduction to d_s = 2, but provides a distinct mechanism 
(projection collapse) and predicts a discontinuous rather than smooth transition. In the locked instantiation presented later (Section V), this discontinuity becomes a concrete, falsifiable discriminator via a dimensionless ratio κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H; κ and its numerical value are defined and derived in Section V.G. 

Bridge to adjacent literatures (terminology + “what to read first”). Readers coming from GR+EFT should treat PCT as proposing a UV/pregeometric completion whose *IR correspondence* is enforced by gates (BC1–BC5), with any beyond-GR content packaged as explicit discriminators rather than as higher-curvature operators; the closest EFT-facing comparison is therefore “what assumptions A1–A6 must be violated to allow a finite-scale non-analytic feature” (see V.G.2 and Theorem 9, plus the calibration-vs-prediction split in V.D and the MASTER checklist V.Z). Readers from GW tests of GR should map “κ” to an analysis target (dimensionless, universal, mass/spin-scaled change-point time) and start with the analysis-ready ringdown protocol and null controls (V.G.15 + Appendix C, then V.Z F1–F4). Readers from the spectral-dimension/QG literature should start with the estimator and step-vs-smooth decision rule (IV.A.5a) and the near-horizon discontinuity module and robustness/continuum-limit checks (V.G–V.J; V.Z F5–F6). Readers from emergent-geometry / entanglement-to-geometry work should start with the primitive object set and the reconstruction map (MINIMAL FORMAL CORE; III.D–III.E; IV.A), and read “projection” and “mediator” as explicit decoding/measure choices (Π, ν_Θ) rather than as a fixed AdS/CFT-style dictionary.

Connections to current programs (translation layer; no new claims).
To help readers map the same results into current mainstream research languages, we restate the paper’s core outputs in three commonly used framings.

(1) EFT / “beyond-GR” language.
In a standard GR+EFT framing, the IR regime is an effective description on a manifold patch Ω where BC1–BC5 pass and where the dynamics can be treated as approximately local. PCT’s correspondence targets (weak-field redshift, hyperbolic propagation, IR d_s≈4 plateau) play the role of matching conditions on the EFT, while the discriminator content is *not* presented as a tower of higher-curvature operators but as a controlled failure mode of those assumptions: a finite-scale non-analytic feature in d_s(ℓ) at ℓ* (summarized by κ≡ℓ*/r_H) and its linked late-time ringdown change-point signature. Operationally, the “EFT question” becomes: which assumption in A1–A6 must be relaxed to admit a step, and what null tests separate that relaxation from estimator/finite-size artifacts (IV.A.5a; V.Z F5–F6).

(2) Quantum information / operational reconstruction language.
In a QI framing, Π and ν_Θ are treated as explicit decoding/selection structure (a channel/measurement family) mapping a pregeometric correlational resource (K, ρ_𝒦) into θ-invariant observables on 𝓜. “Geometry from correlations” is then a statement about which relational statistics are stable under the admissibility filters (microclass axioms and no-signaling/microcausality gates), with horizons defined as a loss of outward-compatible channel capacity (V_{Π,out}→0). The key interpretive move is that many-to-one projection (and record-stability filtering) replaces any assumption that a spacetime Hilbert-space factorization is fundamental.

(3) Cosmological inference / likelihood-facing language.
In an inference framing, the theory’s commitments are the *forward model outputs* that can be compared to data under explicit null hypotheses: (i) a predicted discriminator band for κ (and Δd_s) and (ii) a model-locked prediction band for dn_s/d ln k, together with specified pipelines (Appendix C; V.M.4) and robustness requirements (V.Z). This positions PCT as a hypothesis class that is evaluated by whether its discriminator statistics remain stable under estimator swaps, nuisance sweeps, and extended-parameter marginalization, rather than by narrative correspondence alone.

CITATION PLAN (HOW REFERENCES ARE USED IN THIS MANUSCRIPT)

This paper mixes three reference functions; we label them explicitly so readers can tell when a citation is (i) background, (ii) a baseline constraint, or (iii) a comparator for a specific claim.

(1) Background / standard-theory anchors (orientation; not evidence for PCT).
• QFT and GR/QFT language anchors: [1,2,15,16].
• Standard QM measurement/probability context: [4–6,11].

(2) Comparator / “who predicted what” anchors (positioning; not evidence).
• Discrete/emergent spacetime programmes: causal sets [28,29], CDT [30,31], and related spectral-dimension literature [32,47].
• Holography/entanglement-to-geometry intuition: [25–27,34] (used only for analogy; PCT does not assume AdS/CFT).

(3) External empirical constraints used as non-contradiction checks (not calibrations unless explicitly labeled CAL).
• Weak-field gravity / PPN γ benchmark: Cassini [41] (used as a correspondence/compatibility gate; see V.D and F9).
• GW “tests of GR” context: LVK GWTC-3 [43] (used to contextualize magnitude/analysis windows; the discriminator test is a dedicated change-point analysis specified here).
• CMB constraints: Planck 2018 [39] and r bounds [42] (used as current constraints; the PCT cosmology module is model-locked and falsifiable via F7–F8).

(4) Reporting rule (applies throughout).
• Use citations when: (i) stating a standard baseline result (e.g., “spectral dimension runs in CDT”), (ii) invoking a published constraint number, or (iii) pointing to a canonical definition.
• Do *not* use citations as “evidence for PCT.” Empirical support is counted only when a discriminator module is executed against data with the stated null controls (V.Z; Appendix C).

Parsimony (primitive-count comparison and what the extra structure buys). A close comparator for PCT’s “emergent geometry from a pregeometric relational structure” stance is causal set theory. In its minimal form, causal set theory takes as primitives (i) a locally finite set of “events” and (ii) a partial order \prec encoding causal precedence; additional ingredients are then required to match continuum physics (e.g., a sprinkling/embedding map into a Lorentzian manifold for correspondence, a dynamics/growth law, and matter-field couplings). PCT’s primitive set is larger on paper—(𝒦, K, Π, ν_Θ, ρ_𝒦) rather than (C, \prec)—because it makes three elements explicit that are often implicit or postponed in alternative programmes: (a) an explicit probabilistic projection/decoding map Π and mediator ν_Θ, (b) an explicit population/weight ρ_𝒦, and (c) explicit regime gates (BC1–BC5) that state when GR/QFT language is licensed. The intended “payoff” for this extra primitive structure is not aesthetic; it is empirical and operational: once Π and ν_Θ are specified, PCT yields a computable correlator→distance→operator pipeline that can generate (i) a sharp non-analytic discriminator (a finite-ℓ* step in d_s(ℓ) summarized by κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H) and (ii) a linked cross-channel prediction (the late-time ringdown change-point scaling t_c ∝ κ r_+/c) with explicit null controls, rather than only a correspondence-level dimensional-flow narrative.

Mechanism novelty (what is identical vs modified vs new). At a high level, PCT sits in the same broad family as “emergent-geometry from nonlocal relational data” approaches: it uses a two-point relational object to reconstruct distances/geometry, and it treats a large-scale GR/QFT regime as an IR correspondence target rather than a microscopic starting point. What PCT *modifies* relative to the closest prior approaches is the choice of primitive relational object and the role of “projection”: instead of (i) partial order (causal sets), (ii) simplicial adjacency plus path-integral weights (CDT), or (iii) a pre-imposed boundary-to-bulk dictionary (tensor-network/AdS-CFT intuition), PCT takes a symmetric PSD compatibility kernel K on a constraint space 𝒦 and an explicit projection family Π(·|u;θ) with mediator ν_Θ as primitives, and treats “spacetime talk” as gated by explicit pass/fail diagnostics (BC1–BC5). What is genuinely *new in PCT terms* is the joint mechanism chain:
(𝒦,K,Π,ν_Θ,ρ_𝒦) → induced correlator G₂ → correlation distance d_corr → regime-gated geometry + an operator/horizon module in which (a) horizons are defined as collapse of outward-compatible projection volume V_Π,out (not by importing a metric horizon) and (b) a finite-scale, non-analytic step in d_s(ℓ) arises from a Π-threshold crossing, yielding a universal dimensionless location κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H that then drives a linked late-time ringdown change-point discriminator.

Discriminator | Qualitative feature | Quantitative scale (this paper) | Plausible alternative(s) | What would differ observationally
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Spectral-dimension discontinuity d_s(ℓ) | Non-analytic step (not smooth flow) in d_s(ℓ) | κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H = 0.80 ± 0.05 (PRED); step size Δd_s (PRED) (V.G, V.J) | Finite-size/estimator artifact; smooth QG dimensional flow (CDT/asymptotic safety/Hořava–Lifshitz); horizon inhomogeneity without trapped region | Under alternatives: step disappears under refinement/estimator swap; or d_s(ℓ) changes smoothly with no sharp ℓ*; or the inferred κ is not universal across horizons (V.Z F5–F6)
GW ringdown change-point residual | Late-time, nonstationary change-point in ringdown residual rather than a constant QNM shift | t_c(M,a*) ∝ κ r_+(M,a*)/c with κ universal (PRED); ε_0 ~ 0.02 (PRED); sub-percent level effect (PRED) (V.G.15) | Waveform modeling systematics (start-time choice, missing overtones/modes); detector glitches/calibration drift; exotic compact object echoes | Under alternatives: inferred κ varies with analysis window/detector; no universal t_c/r_+ scaling across events; “echo-like” timing does not correlate with κ derived from d_s(ℓ) (V.Z F1–F4)
CMB running dn_s/d ln k (model-locked) | Enhanced negative running correlated with suppressed r during dimensional transition | dn_s/d ln k = −0.012 ± 0.005 (PRED) and correlated pattern with r (PRED) (V.M) | Standard slow-roll (small running); features in inflation potential; foreground/systematics-induced shifts; extended-parameter degeneracies (N_eff, Σm_ν, Ω_k) | Under alternatives: running consistent with ~0 once robustly marginalized; no correlated (running, r) pattern; sign/magnitude not stable under extended parameter sets (V.Z F7–F8)

Environment-dependent horizon-scaling proxy (secondary) | Boundary-gradient dependence of κ_PCT / T_H proxy at fixed intrinsic trapped-region parameters | ΔT_H/T_H ∝ ΔE_ext (V.C) | Astrophysical radiative transfer/greybody/accretion effects; non-equilibrium horizon physics unrelated to external “constraint environment” | Under alternatives: boundary-gradient proxy has no stable mapping to an invariant ratio; changes do not track E_ext once conventional environment effects are controlled

NUMBERED UNIQUE SIGNATURES (DISCRIMINATORS): OBSERVABLE + EXPECTATION + DEGENERACIES + NULL TEST

Each signature below is stated in a uniform “test card” format.

1) D1 — Spectral-dimension discontinuity (κ, Δd_s).
(i) Observable definition.
• Build/measure a return-probability or heat-trace object P(ℓ) (or an operator L such that P(ℓ)=Tr[e^{−ℓ²L}]) and compute d_s(ℓ):=−2∂ln P(ℓ)/∂ln(ℓ²).
• Extract a step location ℓ* and step size Δd_s using the fixed step-vs-smooth protocol (IV.A.5a), and form κ≡ℓ*/r_H using a horizon-scale proxy r_H defined in the same gated regime.
(ii) Sign/magnitude expectation.
• PCT predicts a non-analytic step: Δd_s>0 with a finite discontinuity at ℓ*.
• Dimensionless location: κ in a narrow, approximately universal band in the canonical instantiation (V.G; V.Z F5–F6).
(iii) Controlling degeneracies.
• Finite-size saturation and boundary effects (d_s→0 at large ℓ): restrict to a pre-saturation window and demonstrate stability under size/refinement changes.
• Estimator artifacts (numerical differentiation/smoothing, trace-estimator choice): require estimator swaps (eig ↔ Hutchinson; return probability ↔ Green-function estimator where feasible).
• “No-horizon mimic” (inhomogeneity-induced steps unrelated to trapped/critical regions): require a matched no-horizon/no-critical control configuration with identical estimator settings.
(iv) Null-test strategy (falsifies PCT).
• Null control: in the no-horizon/no-critical control, the same pipeline must yield Δd_s≈0 (no significant step).
• Falsifier: if, after estimator swaps and at least one refinement, the best-fit step magnitude is consistent with 0 (no statistically significant step), or κ inferred from any step is robustly outside the allowed band, the κ-discontinuity module is ruled out in that domain/scale window (V.Z F5–F6).

2) D2 — GW ringdown late-time change-point residual.
(i) Observable definition.
• Analyze post-merger ringdown strain with late-time-inclusive windowing and start-time marginalization.
• Compare a GR-only model to a change-point residual model ε(t)=0 for t<t_c and ε(t)=ε_0 exp(−(t−t_c)/τ_d) for t≥t_c, and infer a posterior for κ via t_c(M,a*)∝κ r_+(M,a*)/c (V.G.15; Appendix C).
(ii) Sign/magnitude expectation.
• PCT predicts nonstationary structure that turns on at late times, with small amplitude ε_0 at the ∼10^{-2} level (template band), and a dimensionless κ that is (approximately) universal across events once scaled by r_+(M,a*).
(iii) Controlling degeneracies.
• Waveform systematics (start-time choice, overtone/mode content): enforce start-time marginalization and repeat under reasonable waveform/systematics swaps.
• Instrumental artifacts (glitches/calibration drift): enforce multi-detector consistency and off-source time-slide null tests.
• Astrophysical/environmental confounders: require population-level universality of κ (no mass/spin trend beyond allowed scatter) and (when available) cross-mode consistency in multi-mode events.
(iv) Null-test strategy (falsifies PCT).
• Null controls: GR-only injections and off-source time slides through the identical pipeline must calibrate the false-positive distribution for the Bayes factor.
• Falsifier: stacked late-time analyses prefer GR-only at strong odds and/or inferred κ excludes the allowed band or shows significant mass/spin trends inconsistent with a dimensionless invariant (V.Z F1–F4).

3) D3 — CMB running dn_s/d ln k (model-locked).
(i) Observable definition.
• Run ΛCDM+running inference on a stated CMB likelihood combination (V.M.4), reporting a posterior for dn_s/d ln k and its robustness under standard extensions (Ω_k, Σm_ν, N_eff).
(ii) Sign/magnitude expectation.
• PCT predicts enhanced negative running at the |dn_s/d ln k|∼10^{-2} scale in the locked cosmology module (V.M.4).
(iii) Controlling degeneracies.
• Foregrounds/beam/systematics: require multi-frequency/likelihood-component stability.
• Extended-parameter degeneracies: rerun with standard extensions and require sign/magnitude stability.
(iv) Null-test strategy (falsifies PCT).
• Falsifier: if future robust posteriors yield the wrong sign or decisively rule out the predicted magnitude scale at ≥3σ, the locked cosmology module is ruled out (V.Z F7–F8).

4) D4 — Cross-observable shared deformation-channel consistency.
(i) Observable definition.
• Jointly fit clock-rate/redshift observables (constraining Z_t) and propagation-delay/time-of-flight observables (constraining Z_s/Z_t) in the same environment class.
• Test whether a single shared deformation family ρ̄→(Z_t,Z_s) can satisfy both sectors, e.g. via the relation v_char/c = √(Z_s) × (dτ/dt) (V.W; V.Z F10).
(ii) Sign/magnitude expectation.
• PCT predicts one shared deformation channel is sufficient (within the locked functional family) so a joint fit should not strongly prefer independent Z channels.
(iii) Controlling degeneracies.
• Environment mapping uncertainty (ρ̄↔observable): propagate explicitly as nuisance uncertainty and test stability under reasonable mapping variations.
• Dataset-split dependence: repeat joint fit on splits (by instrument, epoch, or system class) to check for hidden systematics.
(iv) Null-test strategy (falsifies PCT).
• Falsifier: strong joint-fit preference for independent deformation channels (or inability to fit both sectors with one shared Z-family) in an environment class where the mapping assumptions are met (V.Z F10).

5) D5 — Environment-dependent horizon-scaling proxy (secondary).
(i) Observable definition.
• In controlled in-silico or analogue realizations, vary the external constraint environment E_ext while holding intrinsic trapped-region parameters fixed; measure the boundary-gradient proxy |∂ρ̄/∂n|_{∂B} and the associated T_H proxy (IV.D.5; V.C).
(ii) Sign/magnitude expectation.
• Leading-order linear response: ΔT_H/T_H ∝ ΔE_ext (V.C.2), with sign determined by the direction of the boundary-gradient response.
(iii) Controlling degeneracies.
• Conventional environment effects that mimic boundary-gradient changes: use matched configurations and isolate E_ext as the only varied input.
• Scheme dependence of boundary estimation: repeat under at least one alternative boundary-gradient estimator/discretization choice.
(iv) Null-test strategy (falsifies PCT).
• Falsifier: in matched control pairs, changing E_ext fails to produce a repeatable, sign-stable response in the boundary-gradient proxy (and the “no-environment-change” control yields a nonzero response), indicating the proxy is not tied to the intended mechanism (V.Z F10 degeneracy-control notes).

SYNTHETIC-TO-REAL BRIDGE (STRESS-TESTING DISCRIMINATORS).
Purpose. Before a discriminator is trusted on real data, it must be stress-tested on a ladder of simulations that interpolate between the paper’s toy/in-silico constructs and instrument-facing realism. The point is not to “optimize until it works,” but to report *where it breaks* under predeclared realism injections (noise, selection, windowing, calibration/systematics), and to demote any discriminator that fails these tests from “risk-bearing” to “scheme-dependent / not yet field-ready.”

Protocol (progressively more realistic stages).
For each discriminator D1–D5, run the identical locked pipeline (same estimator identifiers, priors, and decision thresholds) on each stage below; only the data generator changes.
S0 Toy baseline: analytic/small-graph instances where the true mechanism is known and the expected discriminator output is unambiguous.
S1 Finite-sample + discretization: finite N and resolution/refinement sweeps with controlled sampling noise; verify refinement stability and estimator-swap invariance.
S2 Instrument noise: inject realistic noise models (colored noise / heteroskedasticity where appropriate), plus data conditioning steps (filtering/whitening) that mirror the intended empirical capsule.
S3 Windowing / segmentation: apply the same time/scale windowing used in real analyses (e.g., ringdown start-time marginalization; diffusion-scale truncation); quantify how window choices bias (κ, Δd_s) and change-point evidence.
S4 Selection effects: apply detection/trigger thresholds, censoring, and catalog-selection functions; verify that claimed “universality/coherence” signals are not artifacts of preferentially selecting high-SNR or favorable geometries.
S5 Systematics families: add plausible model-mismatch and calibration families (waveform mismatch, foreground residuals, bandpass uncertainty, normalization drift) and require stability under the predeclared sweep set.

Reporting requirements (what must be shown).
• Breakpoint report: for each discriminator, identify the earliest stage S_k at which the pass/fail decision (or sign of the effect) becomes unstable, and report the minimal realism parameter (e.g., SNR, calibration error, window jitter) that triggers the failure.
• Failure mode label: categorize the failure as (i) estimator instability, (ii) windowing/segmentation non-identifiability, (iii) selection-induced bias, (iv) degeneracy with a conventional alternative model, or (v) insufficient information (power limit).
• “Bridge table” row schema (one row per D and stage): {stage, generator assumptions, realism knobs + ranges, locked pipeline hash/version, null controls executed, decision outcome, uncertainty, and the stated reason if a stage fails}.

Interpretation discipline.
A discriminator is credited as “ready for real-data confrontation” only if it passes through at least S3 (windowing) and remains stable under a declared S5 systematics bracket; otherwise it is retained as a toy/in-silico diagnostic and is not used for headline exclusions.

CANONICAL FALSIFIER STATEMENTS (D–P–S–I form; one line each)

Each discriminator above is intended to be ruled in/out by an explicit if–then falsifier of the form:
“If dataset D processed with protocol P yields statistic S outside interval I, then the model is ruled out (in this domain/scale window).”
Null tests are referenced in parentheses; full thresholds and acceptance criteria are consolidated in V.Z.

D1 (Spectral-dimension discontinuity; κ, Δd_s).
If dataset D = {measured/constructed heat-trace or return-probability object used to compute d_s(ℓ) in the near-horizon/near-critical regime, together with the horizon-scale proxy r_H} processed with protocol P = {fixed d_s(ℓ) estimator + fixed ℓ*-extraction rule + refinement and estimator-swap robustness checks} yields statistic S = (κ, Δd_s) outside interval I = {κ ∈ [0.75,0.85] AND Δd_s ≥ Δd_s,min with the declared step significance}, then the κ-discontinuity module is ruled out in that domain/scale window (null tests: DS-NC1–DS-NC3; falsifiers: V.Z F5–F6).

D2 (GW ringdown change-point; late-time residual).
If dataset D = {post-merger GW strain (or whitened strain + PSD) for a set of ringdown events with parameter-estimation posteriors for (M,a*)} processed with protocol P = {late-time-inclusive windowing with start-time marginalization, explicit systematics/nuisance handling, and stacked model comparison vs GR-only} yields statistic S = ln B(change-point | GR) outside interval I = {ln B ≥ ln B_thr (or equivalently B ≥ B_thr) under the declared false-positive calibration}, then the ringdown change-point discriminator is ruled out in that channel (null tests: GW-NC1–GW-NC3; falsifier: V.Z F1; parameter-band cross-checks: V.Z F2–F4).

D3 (CMB running dn_s/d ln k; model-locked).
If dataset D = {CMB TT/TE/EE + low-ℓ + lensing likelihood data for the stated dataset choice} processed with protocol P = {ΛCDM+running (and declared extensions) with stated priors and convergence criteria} yields statistic S = dn_s/d ln k outside interval I = {dn_s/d ln k ∈ [−0.017, −0.007] (the stated prediction band)}, then the locked cosmology module is ruled out for that dataset/model class (null tests: CMB-NC1–CMB-NC3; falsifier: V.Z F7; correlated-pattern check with r: V.Z F8).

D4 (Cross-observable shared deformation channel; consistency discriminator).
If dataset D = {a joint dataset containing (i) clock-rate/redshift constraints and (ii) propagation-delay/time-of-flight constraints in the same environment class} processed with protocol P = {joint inference enforcing v_char/c = √(Z_s) × (dτ/dt) within the locked Z_t,Z_s family and with explicit environment-mapping uncertainty propagation} yields statistic S = Bayes factor for “shared deformation” vs “independent Z channels” outside interval I = {B(shared | independent) ≥ 1/B_thr (or equivalent joint-fit acceptance threshold)}, then the shared-deformation-channel assumption is ruled out in that domain (null tests: joint-fit placebo checks / dataset splits as applicable; falsifier: V.Z F10).

D5 (Environment-dependent horizon-scaling proxy; secondary).
If dataset D = {a controlled set of horizon realizations (in-silico or analogue) where E_ext is varied while intrinsic trapped-region parameters are held fixed} processed with protocol P = {fixed horizon-location rule + fixed boundary-gradient estimator for |∂ρ̄/∂n| at ∂B} yields statistic S = ΔT_H/T_H outside interval I = {ΔT_H/T_H ≈ χΔE_ext within stated uncertainty and with the “no-environment-change” control yielding ΔT_H/T_H ≈ 0}, then the environment-dependent horizon-scaling proxy is ruled out in that domain (null tests: matched “no-environment-change” controls; falsifier linkage: V.Z F10 degeneracy-control notes).

EXPLAINS vs MERELY REPRODUCES (CLAIMED GAP-FILLING MAP) 

Explanatory core (gates → horizons → geometry; principled vs pragmatic constraints).
PCT’s central explanatory move is that GR/QFT concepts are not assumed but are *licensed* only when explicit regime gates pass; within those gated regimes, horizons and geometry are reconstructed from the same underlying correlator/projection machinery.

WHY THESE CONSTRAINTS? (DERIVATION FROM A SMALL PRINCIPLE SET)

Purpose. This section answers the referee-style question “why *these* constraints (M1–M5, Λ-1…Λ-5, BC1–BC5, and the common proxy conventions) rather than a different list?” We derive the *role* of each constraint from a smaller principle set and explicitly label which constraints are **POSTULATED** (chosen as part of the definition of “PCT-as-used-here”) versus **DERIVED** (forced/strongly motivated given the smaller principle set + the primitive tuple).

Smaller principle set (four families).
S1 Symmetry / invariance. Physics should be defined on θ-invariant, representation-independent quantities (θ declared gauge; diffeo/relabel invariance on 𝓜 once BC1 passes).
S2 Optimization / economy. Prefer minimal additional structure that (i) makes predictions computable and (ii) avoids unconstrained variant flexibility (parameter economy and non-vacuity of falsifiers).
S3 Information / operationality. “Physical” statements are those tied to operationally reportable statistics on 𝓜 (preparations/transformations/measurements), with stable records and non-signaling.
S4 Consistency / well-posedness. The emergent effective description must be mathematically well-defined (measurability/normalization) and dynamically well-posed where causal language is used (hyperbolicity/admissibility), and must admit controlled limits/refinement stability when claiming continuum physics.

From principles → constraint families (derivation sketch).
• (S4) forces well-posed probabilistic/measure-theoretic primitives: Π must be a Markov kernel and ν_Θ a probability measure; otherwise G₂ and all downstream objects are undefined.
• (S1)+(S3) force “no GR/QFT language before gates” and θ-invariant reporting; without this, claims become representation-dependent and non-operational.
• (S4) forces a gate that distinguishes “label space” from “manifold geometry” (BC1) and a separate gate that distinguishes “arbitrary operator” from “causal/well-posed propagation” (BC2).
• (S3) forces no-signaling and record-stability as admissibility/selection constraints; without them, the framework permits controllable superluminal signaling or arbitrary, unstable “outcome” definitions.
• (S2)+(S4) force stability/robustness checks (microclass axioms, spectral convergence, refinement stability) so that discriminator claims are not artifacts of discretization/estimator choices.

POSTULATED vs DERIVED ledger (compact).
Legend.
• (POST) = explicitly postulated as part of the framework definition (a choice of admissibility/interpretation discipline).
• (DER) = derived/forced once the smaller principles above are accepted (possibly conditional on stated regularity assumptions).
• (MIXED) = part postulate (e.g., “we choose to enforce this as a gate”) and part derived (e.g., “given we want X, some version of this gate is necessary”).

Constraint / gate / convention | Role in the theory | Principle source | Status
---|---|---|---
θ declared gauge; only θ-invariant observables count (V.S) | removes representational drift; defines what is “physical” | S1, S3 | (POST)
“No GR/QFT language before gates” rule (Intro; Def. III.F.2) | prevents scope drift; makes correspondence claims conditional | S1, S3 | (POST)
M1 (K symmetric PSD + regularity/decay) | makes correlations well-defined; enables RKHS/positivity tools | S4 | (POST → but strongly compelled by S4)
M2–M3 (Π Markov kernel; ν_Θ normalized) | ensures G₂ is well-defined as a pushforward; enables Born-volume construction | S4 | (DER)
M4 (correlation-distance compatibility) | ensures “distance/metric” talk is meaningful on a patch | S4 | (MIXED)
M5 (spectral convergence / stable IR windows) | ensures d_s(ℓ) and IR dimension claims survive refinement | S4, S2 | (MIXED)
Λ-1…Λ-2 (measurability + normalization) | minimal well-posedness of the mediator layer | S4 | (DER)
Λ-3 (robustness away from declared critical transitions) | prevents “anything goes” θ-instability; keeps outputs stable | S2, S4 | (MIXED)
Λ-4 (no-signaling admissibility) | excludes controllable superluminal signaling while allowing correlations | S3, S4 | (POST)
Λ-5 (microclass compatibility) | ties mediator freedom to the microclass; prevents variant escape hatches | S2, S4 | (POST)
BC1 (manifold-likeness gate) | licenses geometry talk only when local quadratic/additive structure holds | S4 | (MIXED)
BC2 (hyperbolicity/admissibility gate) | licenses causal/microcausality talk only when cones are well-defined | S4, S3 | (MIXED)
BC3–BC5 (kernel/projection admissibility + “slowly varying ρ̄”) | licenses IR/QFT-like reasoning and excludes pathological choices | S4, S2 | (MIXED)
Metric-proxy convention g_tt:=-1/Z_t, g_rr:=1/Z_s and (when invoked) g_tt g_rr = −1 | a representational choice to connect principal-symbol data to a familiar GR form | S1, S2 | (POST)
Theorem-level consequences (e.g., Theorem 5 metric extraction; Lemma III.F.8 cone proxy under BC2) | establishes what is actually derived once gates/regularity hold | S4 | (DER)

Interpretation discipline (what “derived” means here).
• “Derived” does not mean “empirically confirmed.” It means “forced once the primitives and the smaller principle set are accepted,” subject to any explicitly stated regularity assumptions.
• Where a row is marked (MIXED), the *need for a gate of that type* is derived, while the exact numerical tolerances (ε_quad, ε_path, ε_out, etc.) remain (POST) reporting conventions.

(1) Gates as “meaning conditions” (why GR/QFT language is not free-floating).
• Principled: BC2 (causal admissibility / hyperbolicity) is a consistency requirement for any well-posed effective dynamics and for microcausality/no-signaling interpretations (no cones ⇒ no causal statements).
• Principled: BC1 (manifold-likeness) is a consistency requirement for treating correlator-derived distances as a local metric geometry (no local quadratic/additive structure ⇒ no geometric claims).
• Pragmatic: the specific diagnostic tolerances (ε_quad, ε_path) and numerical estimator choices used to declare “PASS” are reporting conventions; they can be tightened/loosened without changing the underlying conceptual role of the gates.

(2) Horizon criteria as a projection-native boundary (why “horizons” are not presupposed).
• Principled: the horizon notion is defined operationally as loss of outward-compatible propagation/projection capacity (U_out empty or V_Π,out → 0), i.e., a statement about what the admissible operator/projection family permits in the exterior.
• Pragmatic: the outward-admissibility threshold ε_out and any “regularized near-horizon” cutoffs are numerical/operational choices that make the definition testable and robust on finite realizations; they are not claimed to be uniquely fixed by the microclass axioms.

(3) Emergent geometry as a reconstruction output (why the same constraints do explanatory work).
• Principled: correlator decay defines a correlation distance and (when smoothness holds) a local metric proxy g_μν; the point is not the specific coordinate representation but the existence of a stable reconstruction map from (𝒦, K, Π, ν_Θ) to (d_corr, g_μν, d_s(ℓ)).
• Pragmatic: particular representational conventions (e.g., α=1 vs α=2 in the distance functional, the proxy-metric conventions g_tt := −1/Z_t and g_rr := 1/Z_s, and the locked functional families in Section V) are choices made to produce one reproducible instantiation; alternative admissible choices define different PCT variants.

Bottom line. The “constraints” are doing explanatory work when they (i) restrict meaning/interpretation (via gates), (ii) define horizons without importing GR geometry, and (iii) enable a concrete correlator→distance→geometry reconstruction—rather than merely serving as tunable fit knobs.

Counterfactual analysis (why the gates are not ad hoc).
To make the “constraints do explanatory work” claim falsifiable at the level of internal structure, consider relaxing one gate at a time (conceptually, or in a toy instance). The point is not that *any* relaxation is impossible, but that specific desiderata fail in specific, predictable ways once the corresponding gate is removed.

| Gate / constraint relaxed (counterfactual) | What breaks (first-order failure) | Desired property lost (what the gate was buying) | Where enforced (so this is checkable) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Relax BC1 (manifold-likeness: quadratic residual + path additivity) | Correlator-distance no longer supports a stable local quadratic expansion; different coordinate charts/estimators yield incompatible “metrics.” | Geometry talk becomes undefined/unstable (no consistent $g_{\mu\nu}$ / curvature claims; 𝓜 reverts to label space). | BC1 checklist; IV.A.6; Definition III.F.2 |
| Relax BC2 (hyperbolicity/admissibility: $Z_t>0, Z_s>0$ on Ω) | Principal symbol loses hyperbolicity; characteristics are ill-defined; retarded/causal support can fail. | Microcausality / well-posed effective dynamics (no consistent cones; “no signaling outside cones” cannot be maintained). | BC2 checklist; IV.B.4 (eqIV.B.18–eqIV.B.19); Definition III.F.8 |
| Relax the outward-admissibility thresholding in the horizon module (ε_out; Θ_out and $V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}$) | “Horizon” becomes either trivially absent (if any tiny outward mode counts) or trivially present (if any suppression counts), and becomes highly scheme-dependent. | A non-arbitrary operational horizon notion and a usable boundary for leakage bookkeeping. | Definition III.F.4–III.F.7; IV.D.1 (eqIV.D.3–eqIV.D.5) |
| Relax Π-factorization / no-signaling admissibility (Λ-4; V.U) | Local marginals can become setting-dependent under spacelike-separated interventions (controllable signaling). | Operational compatibility with Bell-type nonlocal correlations *without* superluminal control. | Λ-4; OP5; V.U |
| Relax record-stability / robustness selection (V.T) | Outcome partitions become context-fragile; “measurement” can be tuned arbitrarily by unstable Π/θ sectors; Born-volume weighting becomes operationally ambiguous. | Stable classical records and a non-arbitrary link from fiber weights to observed frequencies. | OP3; V.T |

Interpretation. This counterfactual table is the intended sense in which the constraints are explanatory rather than ad hoc: each gate corresponds to a concrete failure mode in the emergent description when it is removed, and each is enforced in a specific, auditable location.

The table below distinguishes (i) correspondence targets PCT is constructed to reproduce, from (ii) explanatory gaps PCT claims to fill. For each “explains” item we name a competing approach and the specific gap being addressed.

REPRODUCES (correspondence targets) | What is reproduced (macro-level statement) 
• GR weak-field redshift/time dilation: dτ/dt ≈ √(1−r_s/r) once f(ρ̄) is calibrated (V.D). 
• GR-like cone structure / finite characteristic speed: hyperbolic operator family with v_char(x) = c√(Z_s/Z_t) and Minkowski limit (IV.B). 
• Standard local-field/QFT regime in IR: approximately local propagation when ρ̄ is slowly varying and Z_t,Z_s ≈ 1 (IV.E.1). 

EXPLAINS (claimed mechanism/ontology) | Competing approach (typical stance) | Claimed gap PCT fills (specific) 
• Why geometry/metric structure emerges at all (from correlator decay and d_corr). | GR / semiclassical gravity. | GR presupposes a differentiable manifold with metric as primitive; PCT supplies an explicit reconstruction pipeline (G₂ → d_corr → g_μν) that does not assume spacetime geometry and states the conditions under which a manifold-like regime exists (III.D.6, IV.A). 
• Why microcausality appears (no signaling outside characteristic cones). | QFT axioms (microcausality postulate) and algebraic QFT. | Standard QFT imposes microcausality as an axiom about commutators; PCT makes it an admissibility/consistency condition on the induced generator L_ρ (hyperbolicity of the principal symbol A^{μν}), tying “no signaling” to the existence of well-posed emergent dynamics rather than to a separate postulate (IV.B, C2). 
• Why dimensional reduction occurs (and why it can be discontinuous at finite κ). | CDT / asymptotic safety / Hořava–Lifshitz (spectral dimension flow). | Competing approaches typically predict smooth/continuous d_s(ℓ) flow; PCT claims a distinct, testable non-analytic signature: a discontinuous jump at ℓ* (equivalently κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H), and provides an operator/projection mechanism for the jump rather than a smooth RG running alone (V.G; Master falsification in V.Z). 
• Why horizons can be defined operationally without presupposing GR geometry. | GR (event horizon as geometric/causal boundary of a spacetime metric). | GR defines horizons once the metric is given; PCT defines horizons directly as collapse of outward-compatible projection volume V_Π,out (or absence of outward characteristic modes), i.e., a criterion expressed purely in projection/admissibility terms that can be evaluated even when manifold reconstruction becomes marginal (IV.D, C4). 
• Why Born probabilities have a geometric/measure-theoretic origin (volume of preimages). | Copenhagen (Born rule postulate) / Everettian derivations / decision-theoretic accounts. | Many approaches either postulate Born’s rule or derive it with additional rationality/symmetry assumptions; PCT claims a direct measure-theoretic mechanism: probabilities arise from projection-fiber weights W(m)=∫_{F(m)}ρ_𝒦 dV_𝒦 (and its RKHS interpretation), explicitly linking outcome statistics to projection volume under constraints (III.C; IV.D/V.T provide operational selection constraints). 

Explanatory-power commitments (made explicit). The “explains vs reproduces” entries above are intended as mechanistic claims, not as rhetorical positioning. To make the comparative burden concrete, we state here what would count as demonstrating comparative explanatory power in this manuscript, and what we do (and do not) claim about competing approaches.

(1) What “cannot be accommodated” means (scope-limited). When we state that a discriminator is not accommodated by a given baseline, the claim is always relative to that baseline’s standard assumptions. For example, for GR+local EFT we mean assumptions A1–A6 in V.G.2 (locality, unitarity, diffeomorphism invariance, smooth background, no new light degrees of freedom, no nonlocal/topological effects). Under those assumptions, a finite-scale discontinuity in d_s(ℓ) is excluded (V.G.2; Theorem 9). If one relaxes those assumptions (e.g., adds explicit nonlocality, topology change, or a new threshold degree of freedom), then the discriminator may be mimicable in principle—at which point the comparison shifts from “cannot” to “can, but only by adding a new mechanism,” and the explanatory question becomes whether that added mechanism is less ad hoc / more unified than PCT’s projection-threshold mechanism.

(2) What PCT adds beyond a correspondence match: new variance, not just new labels. An explanation is treated as stronger than a reproduction only when it generates additional structured variance—i.e., cross-observable relations, scaling laws, or regime-gated failure modes that are not freely adjustable once the primitives/locked choices are fixed. In this manuscript those “variance” outputs are:
• A non-analytic signature: a discontinuous step in d_s(ℓ) at finite ℓ* (equivalently κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H), rather than a smooth RG flow (V.G; V.J).
• A linked late-time observable structure: a ringdown change-point at t_c(M,a*) ∝ κ r_+(M,a*)/c with a constrained template family (V.G.15; V.Z F1–F4).
• A cross-observable consistency relation between clock-rate and propagation sector, v_char/c = √(Z_s) × (dτ/dt), which can fail even if each sector individually matches correspondence targets (V.W; V.Z F10).
• An explicit regime gate: claims phrased in GR/QFT language are only permitted when manifold-likeness and admissibility diagnostics pass (“OPERATIONAL ‘APPLIES WHEN…’ CONDITIONS”). This makes explanatory claims falsifiable by internal inconsistency, not only by external data.

(3) Comparative checklist (what this manuscript aims to show, operationally). To address the criticism that “comparative explanatory power is asserted more than demonstrated,” we treat the following as the minimum comparative burden for each claimed “explains” item:
• Mechanism specification: name the internal object that does the explanatory work (e.g., Π-threshold collapse, admissibility/hyperbolicity constraint, projection-fiber measure) and show the derivation map from primitives → mediator → observable (C1–C7).
• Non-ad-hocness: show that the mechanism is not introduced solely to fit one dataset, but is tied to admissibility/microclass constraints or to a single shared structure that also generates other outputs (e.g., the same L_ρ controls both microcausality and d_s(ℓ)).
• Added variance: identify at least one additional prediction or cross-observable relation that would not follow from merely reproducing GR/QFT correspondence targets (items above).
• Alternative accommodation cost: when a competing approach could match the discriminator, state explicitly what new ingredient it must add (e.g., explicit nonlocality, topology change, a threshold degree of freedom, or a new postulate about microcausality/Born rule), and whether that ingredient is independent or overlaps with the ingredients already required for that approach’s other successes.

WHAT PCT IS *NOT* (OUT-OF-SCOPE CHECKLIST; READ BEFORE INTERPRETING RESULTS)

Use these as hard “non-claims” for the Results/Contributions section below. When a reader is tempted to read a statement as “full quantum gravity,” check it against this list; if it would require any item below, it is out of scope by definition.

[NOT-1] Not “a complete theory of quantum gravity.” PCT is a discriminator-first reconstruction *programme* with explicit regime gates (BC1–BC5); it does not claim to already supply the full content normally expected of a final QG theory (unique dynamics, matter sector, and all regimes covered).

[NOT-2] Not a derivation of full GR dynamics. This manuscript provides kinematic reconstruction and gated effective-geometry/propagation structure; it does not derive Einstein’s equations or a complete intrinsic micro-dynamics/closure on (𝒦,K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ).

[NOT-3] Not a Standard Model embedding. No realistic gauge+matter sector (SM gauge group, chiral fermions, anomaly cancellation, full matter content) is constructed here beyond minimal toy “presence proofs.”

[NOT-4] Not a unique, regulator-independent UV completion. The UV story here is scoped to microclass admissibility + the explicit consistency/robustness checks performed; full scheme/regulator independence for all observables is not shown.

[NOT-5] Not an executed empirical confirmation. Any IR agreement with established physics is treated as a correspondence target (CAL/compatibility) rather than evidence; only discriminator passes under explicit null controls would count as evidential weight.

[NOT-6] Not a decision-calibrated applied model. The framework is not presented as a basis for forecasting/engineering/policy decisions.

Program stance (explicit) — Minimal recipe (inputs → steps → outputs).

Given X (what you start from; choose one).
X1 (model-side input; used for in-silico tests):
• A discrete or continuum realisation of the PCT primitives: (𝒦, K(u,v), ρ_𝒦(u), Π(·|u;θ), ν_Θ).

X2 (data-side input; used for empirical confrontation):
• Either (a) a weighted graph / Laplacian-like operator L extracted from data (or directly measured diffusion/return-probability P(ℓ)), and any horizon-scale proxy r_H needed to form κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H;
• Or (b) ringdown strain data + PSD + event posteriors for (M,a*) (for the change-point discriminator).

Required steps (must be done for *any* PCT claim on 𝓜).
1. Specify the analysis domain and scale window.
   Output: a stated region Ω ⊂ 𝓜 and scale window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁] for every claim (scope gate rule).

2. Build the induced correlator (model-side) OR accept an operator/heat-trace surrogate (data-side).
   • Model-side: compute G₂(x,y;θ) from (𝒦,K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ) (eqIV.A.1).
   • Data-side: specify the operator L (or the measured P(ℓ)) that will be used to compute d_s(ℓ).
   Output O1: G₂ (or L / P(ℓ) as the surrogate object).

3. Enforce the regime gates (license for GR/QFT language).
   • BC1 (manifold-likeness) on (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) if you will talk about distances/metric/curvature.
   • BC2 (admissibility / hyperbolicity) on Ω if you will talk about causal cones, v_char, horizons.
   Output O2: a PASS/FAIL report for each required BC item (with the diagnostics used).

4. Compute θ-invariant outputs on 𝓜 (what is actually compared to data).
   Output set O (minimum):
   • O3: d_s(ℓ) over [ℓ₀,ℓ₁] from P(ℓ)=Tr[e^{−ℓ²L_ρ}] (or its surrogate) (eqIV.A.6–eqIV.A.7).
   • O4: (ℓ*, Δd_s) via a fixed extraction rule (V.G.5 / IV.A.5a).
   • O5: κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H (only if r_H is defined in the same gated regime).

Optional steps (only if you need the corresponding outputs; mark as optional in text where used).
5. Geometry reconstruction branch (optional; requires BC1 PASS).
   Compute Ĝ₂ → d_corr → local metric proxy g^{(E)}_{μν} (eqIV.A.2–eqIV.A.4).
   Optional outputs: O6 = d_corr, O7 = g^{(E)}_{μν} (and curvature scalars if computed).

6. Causal/propagation branch (optional; requires BC2 PASS).
   Compute/fit the principal-symbol deformation (Z_t,Z_s) and v_char/c = √(Z_s/Z_t) (IV.B–IV.C).
   Optional outputs: O8 = v_char(x), cone proxy g^{(L)}_{μν}.

7. Horizon/leakage branch (optional; requires BC2 PASS + near-horizon suppression diagnostics).
   Compute Θ_out(x) and V_{Π,out}(x); identify ∂B and r_H; compute κ_PCT and T_H proxy if used (IV.D).
   Optional outputs: O9 = V_{Π,out}, O10 = ∂B and r_H, O11 = κ_PCT and T_H proxy.

8. Correspondence calibration (optional but often necessary; not evidence).
   Calibrate weak-field mapping f(ρ̄) ↔ r_s/r (V.D) (and any units/normalizations).
   Optional outputs: O12 = calibrated parameters/mappings (explicitly labeled CAL).

9. Discriminator confrontation (optional; but required for any “evidence” claim).
   Compare the discriminator outputs to data via the declared falsifiers (V.Z):
   • D1: step vs smooth-flow + κ band test on d_s(ℓ) (F5–F6).
   • D2: ringdown change-point model comparison + κ universality checks (F1–F4).
   Output O13: a pass/fail statement against the explicit falsification thresholds.

PRE-REGISTERED DECISION RULES (STATISTIC + THRESHOLD + NULL).
Purpose. Lock the exact decision statistics, thresholds, and null definitions for each discriminator so the paper’s evidential claims are not post-hoc.

Table PR-1 — Pre-registered decision rules (apply uniformly).
Discriminator | Statistic (exact) | Pass threshold | Null definition (what counts as “no effect”)
---|---|---|---
D1: $d_s(\ell)$ step (near-horizon) | Either $\Delta\mathrm{AIC}$ (step vs smooth) or $\ln B_{\mathrm{step}/\mathrm{smooth}}$ for the *fixed* model pair in IV.A.5a / V.G.5 | PASS if ($\Delta\mathrm{AIC}\ge 10$) or ($\ln B_{\mathrm{step}/\mathrm{smooth}}\ge 5$), AND the qualitative verdict is invariant under the estimator-swap audit (Table D1-A) | NULL if $\ln B_{\mathrm{step}/\mathrm{smooth}}\le 0$ AND $|\Delta d_s|\le 2\sigma_{\Delta d_s}$ in the matched no-horizon/no-critical control (same pipeline/settings)
D2: GW ringdown change-point | $\ln B_{\mathrm{CP}/\mathrm{GR}}$ (change-point vs GR-only) from the declared likelihood/template family (V.G.15; V.Z F1–F4) | PASS if $\ln B_{\mathrm{CP}/\mathrm{GR}}\ge 5$ in stacked analyses AND the result is stable under the declared waveform/systematics swaps AND the calibrated null rate satisfies $P(\ln B\ge 5)\le 1\%$ under slides/injections | NULL if $\ln B_{\mathrm{CP}/\mathrm{GR}}\le 0$ on real events *and* slides/injections show no excess above the calibrated false-positive rate
D3: CMB running capsule (optional) | Evidence for running from a fixed comparison of “no-running” vs “running” models, reported as $\ln B_{\mathrm{run}/0}$ (or an explicitly stated equivalent, e.g. $\Delta\mathrm{AIC}$) | PASS if $\ln B_{\mathrm{run}/0}\ge 5$ AND the inferred running excludes 0 at 95% credibility under the declared prior family | NULL if $\ln B_{\mathrm{run}/0}\le 0$ AND running is consistent with 0 at 95% credibility under the declared priors

Additional pre-registered coherence check (cross-discriminator).
• If both D1 and D2 are claimed as “detected” on the same physical system/class, then the inferred $\kappa$ values must be mutually consistent within the stated uncertainty budget (including sweep/systematics envelopes). If not, the joint claim is rejected even if each single-channel statistic individually crosses its threshold.

WHAT WOULD FALSIFY THIS PAPER? (BULLET OUTCOMES; PRE-REGISTERED).
The following outcomes constitute falsification of the paper’s main discriminator claims (within the stated scope gates and locked analysis protocol):
• (F1) D1 fails its decision rule on all admissible datasets/control constructions: step-vs-smooth never reaches PASS, or the verdict flips across the estimator-swap audit (Table D1-A).
• (F2) A “step” appears in matched no-horizon/no-critical controls at the same rate/strength as in the target construction (i.e., the primary null does not stay null).
• (F3) Where a step is detected, inferred $\kappa$ lies outside the locked band $[0.75,0.85]$ after propagating $r_H$ uncertainty (NC-1), or the inferred $\Delta d_s$ is inconsistent with the locked band (NC-2) without an explicit, documented variant change.
• (F4) D2 fails its decision rule under calibrated nulls: slides/injections yield $P(\ln B_{\mathrm{CP}/\mathrm{GR}}\ge 5)>1\%$, or real-event preferences are not stable under declared waveform/systematics swaps.
• (F5) If both D1 and D2 pass individually, but the inferred $\kappa$ values disagree beyond the stated envelope, the joint “one mechanism explains both” claim is rejected.

CASE STUDY (END-TO-END): GW RINGDOWN CHANGE-POINT AS A COMPLEX-SYSTEM EXPLANATION

Goal (what is being explained, not just fit).
Explain why a complicated, nonstationary late-time residual could appear *only after* a characteristic time, while leaving earlier ringdown GR-like: the “change-point turns on at $t_c$ because the near-horizon sector undergoes a finite-scale transition summarized by $\kappa \equiv \ell^*/r_H$.”

Inputs → gates → outputs (single concrete walk-through).

Inputs (data-side; explicit).
• D: post-merger strain time series for one event (e.g., a high-SNR BBH), plus per-detector PSD estimate and calibration-uncertainty model.
• PE: posterior samples for remnant mass/spin (M,a*) (to define r_+(M,a*) and convert a dimensionless $\kappa$ into a physical time).
• Domain choice: a late-time-inclusive ringdown analysis window [t_0,t_1] with start-time marginalization.

Gates (what must be true before interpreting “GR/QFT language”).
• BC2 (admissibility / hyperbolicity): the effective propagation sector is assumed admissible in the exterior region used by the ringdown template (so “characteristic speed,” “horizon radius,” and $t_c\propto r_+$ are meaningful within the model).
• Scope gate: declare the window and the operational rule used for t_c (V.G.15); no claim is made outside that window.

Mechanism (PCT causal story; internal object doing the work).
• A finite-scale transition at $\ell^*$ implies a late-time change-point at
  $t_c(M,a*) = \kappa\, r_+(M,a*)/c$.
• Before $t_c$, the waveform should be essentially GR (the signal has not “sampled” the transition sector); after $t_c$, a small additional component turns on and decays, consistent with the template family in V.G.15.

Outputs (what you report).
• Posterior on $\kappa$ (median + CI) and model-comparison statistic (Bayes factor or Δln Z) for “change-point vs GR-only,” as specified in Appendix C / V.Z.
• A diagnostic showing start-time robustness and null-control false-positive calibration (Appendix C.6).

What differs under a null / alternative model.
• Null model (GR-only): the data are described by a stationary GR ringdown without a localized late-time switch-on; any apparent late-time preference for a change-point should disappear under null controls (off-source time slides; GR-only injections) and should not yield a universal dimensionless $\kappa$ across events.
• Alternative (systematics or exotic compact objects): a late-time residual can exist, but (i) its preferred “turn-on time” need not scale as $t_c/r_+ \approx \mathrm{const}$, (ii) it can vary strongly with windowing/PSD choices, and (iii) it will typically fail the universality and multi-detector/multi-mode consistency checks codified as F1–F4.

What counts as “confirmation” (explicit). Agreement with GR/QFT in the IR is treated as a correspondence target (a necessary consistency check) and does not count as evidential confirmation of PCT by itself (see [NOT-5]; also [NOT-1]–[NOT-2] for what “confirmation” would *not* mean). In this manuscript, confirmation would require detection of at least one discriminator that is not a built-in calibration target—e.g., the near-horizon dimensional discontinuity (κ, Δd_s), its associated late-time ringdown change-point structure, or the correlated cosmology signatures (enhanced negative running with suppressed r)—with the corresponding null-hypotheses rejected under the Master Falsification Checklist (V.Z, F1–F10).

WORKED COMPLEX-SYSTEM EXAMPLE (ONE MECHANISM → MULTIPLE PHENOMENA; PLUS A FAILURE DEMO)

Purpose (complex-systems lens). Show how a *single* control mechanism—projection-threshold collapse in an order-parameter field ρ̄—acts like a phase transition that simultaneously organizes several “macro” observables (dimensional diagnostics, propagation/cones, and horizon/leakage), and also show the cleanest way the story can fail (mimics and artifacts).

System (schematic, but fully specified at the level PCT actually uses).
We model a large, finite correlation network as a weighted graph realization of the PCT primitives:
• Pregeometry (micro): a node set 𝒦 with population ρ_𝒦(u) and PSD kernel weights K(u,v).
• Projection layer (meso): Π(x|u;θ) with a finite width σ_Π, and mediator ν_Θ.
• Emergent label space (macro surrogate): a graph/operator L (standing in for L_ρ) on a set of labels 𝓜, from which we compute diffusion/heat-trace observables.

Single mechanism (the “phase transition”).
Define the projected environment/order parameter ρ̄(x;θ) (eqIV.C.2). Fix a critical value ρ̄_crit and an ε_out threshold. The mechanism is:

  ρ̄(x) crossing ρ̄_crit  ⇒  the outward-admissible sector Θ_out(x) shrinks  ⇒  V_{Π,out}(x) collapses  
  ⇒  effective operator/diffusion structure changes non-analytically at a finite scale ℓ*.

One mechanism ⇒ three emergent “macro” phenomena (compression of explanation).
In this schematic model, the *same* threshold/collapse event accounts for:

(1) Dimensional diagnostic (d_s step).
• Observable: d_s(ℓ) from P(ℓ)=Tr[e^{−ℓ²L}] (eqIV.A.6–eqIV.A.7).
• Mechanism link: as Π-thresholding suppresses outward-compatible sectors, the effective spectrum sampled by the heat trace changes sharply, producing a finite-scale step at ℓ* and hence the discriminator pair (κ,Δd_s).

(2) Propagation/casual-cone deformation (v_char slowdown).
• Observable: v_char/c = √(Z_s/Z_t) (eqIV.B.13) (only where BC2 passes).
• Mechanism link: the same increase in ρ̄ that drives projection-sector collapse also drives anisotropic deformation (Z_t,Z_s), reducing v_char and sharpening the operational distinction between exterior and near-critical regions.

(3) Horizon/leakage bookkeeping (V_{Π,out} and T_H proxy).
• Observables: V_{Π,out}(x) (eqIV.D.4–eqIV.D.5) and κ_PCT/T_H proxy (eqIV.D.15c–eqIV.D.15d).
• Mechanism link: the same boundary steepness that appears when ρ̄ approaches ρ̄_crit controls κ_PCT (thermality scaling), while the shrinking Θ_out set controls the escape amplitude (V_{Π,out}).

Where the compressed explanation can fail (explicit failure demo).
The “one mechanism explains many signatures” story fails cleanly in three main ways; these are not afterthoughts—they are the *required* null controls:

Failure F-1 (finite-size saturation mimic).
• Symptom: d_s(ℓ) shows an apparent drop at large ℓ simply because the system is finite, with d_s(ℓ)→0.
• Fix: restrict to a pre-saturation window and demonstrate stability under size/refinement increase (V.J; V.Z F5).

Failure F-2 (estimator/smoothing artifact mimic).
• Symptom: numerical differentiation or smoothing produces an apparent step at ℓ* that shifts or disappears under estimator swaps.
• Fix: run the step-vs-smooth decision under estimator swaps (eig ↔ Hutchinson / alternate slope estimators) and require stable (ℓ*,Δd_s) (IV.A.5a; V.Z F5).

Failure F-3 (“no-horizon mimic”: inhomogeneity without a trapped/critical regime).
• Symptom: inhomogeneous weights can create a step-like feature in d_s(ℓ) even when there is no genuine collapse of outward compatibility (V_{Π,out} not suppressed; no near-horizon diagnostics).
• Fix: require a matched no-horizon/no-critical control with the engineered trapped/critical region removed; demand Δd_s≈0 in the control while the horizon case remains step-positive (V.Z F5–F6).

Interpretation (what this example is meant to demonstrate).
If (and only if) the same controlled threshold event simultaneously yields (i) a step in d_s(ℓ), (ii) near-critical cone deformation/speed suppression, and (iii) outward-compatibility collapse/leakage proxies—and all three survive the null controls above—then PCT has the intended “complex-system-style” explanatory compression: multiple macroscopic regularities are traced to one mechanism rather than introduced as independent fit knobs.

Worked counterfactual “gate removal” numerical example (deliberate BC2 violation → predicted observable failure mode).
Purpose. Make the gate logic concrete: we now take the *same* toy near-horizon instance used in IV.D.8 / V.B, and then deliberately violate BC2 by removing the exterior admissibility regularization. The prediction is not a subtle parameter shift—it is a categorical, reportable failure: the propagation/cone observables are declared out of scope (BC2=FAIL), and any downstream “causal” quantities (v_char, ringdown timing map, horizon-leakage causal wording) are not reportable.

Set-up (locked deformation; v52 toy numbers).
Use the locked deformation in IV.D.8: Z_s(\bar\rho)=1−f(\bar\rho), Z_t(\bar\rho)=1/(1−f(\bar\rho)). In the admissible exterior (with the ε-regularization in place), representative points have (V.B.2):
  r = 3.61: v_char/c = 0.2637  (POST; toy run),
and at the regularized boundary limit one has v_char/c ≈ 10^{−3} (POST; toy run summary in IV.D.8).

Counterfactual intervention (remove BC2-enforcing sign/regularization at the boundary).
Now remove the near-boundary regularization and evaluate directly at the toy boundary location r_B ≃ 4.574 (IV.D.8), where the horizon-location rule is f(\bar\rho(r_B)) = 1.
Then, *at that same point*,
  Z_s(r_B) = 1−f = 0,
  Z_t(r_B) = 1/(1−f) → +∞,
so the BC2 admissibility predicate (Z_t>0 and Z_s>0 on Ω_ext) fails at first contact because Z_s=0 and the principal-symbol normalization diverges.

Predicted failure mode in reported observables (what changes in the paper’s reporting ledger).
Under the manuscript’s scope-gating rule, the output consequences are immediate and checkable:
• BC2 status flips from PASS → FAIL at r_B (because Z_s is not strictly positive).
• The propagation observable is *not reportable*: v_char is undefined/out-of-scope at r_B (do not report “v_char/c=0” as a physical speed, because the cone sector is not admissible).
• Any downstream causal-language mapping is disabled in that region/window: ringdown timing claims using t_c=κ r_+(M,a*)/c are not licensed there, and “outward propagation suppressed inside cones” language is not permitted.

Optional stronger counterfactual (BC2 failure by sign flip inside the boundary).
If one probes just inside the boundary (a toy interior point with f=1.02 as a deliberately constructed counterexample), then Z_s=−0.02 and Z_t=−50 so BC2 fails by sign. A naive computation would still give √(Z_s/Z_t)=0.02, but the *sign failure* is exactly what BC2 is designed to catch: the cone/causal interpretation is invalid even if the ratio happens to be positive.

Takeaway.
This is the intended “explanatory power for complexity” point: the gate is not decorative. When BC2 is removed/violated, the framework predicts a specific, categorical breakdown in the observable ledger (v_char and all causal downstreams become non-reportable), rather than merely producing a slightly different fit.

Strengths (comparative + test-linked; single list). 
• Predicts a discontinuous near-horizon spectral-dimension jump at finite κ (not merely generic smooth dimensional flow), with explicit falsifiers via ringdown change-point and analogue d_s(ℓ) step tests (V.G, V.K, V.Z). 
• Provides an explicit correlator-to-geometry reconstruction pipeline (G₂ → d_corr → g_μν) rather than assuming a background manifold/metric and then quantizing it (III.D.6, IV.A). 
• Makes microcausality operational (admissibility/hyperbolicity of L_ρ) rather than an independent postulate, yielding a concrete “allowed model space” criterion (IV.B, C2). 
• Defines horizons by projection-volume collapse (V_Π,out → 0) rather than by metric presupposition, enabling a horizon criterion even when manifold-likeness is marginal (IV.D, C4). 
• Produces analysis-ready discriminators (templates + priors + robustness requirements) rather than qualitative signatures only (V.G.15; consolidated falsification in V.Z). 

What this manuscript adds (self-contained framing). This paper is written to be usable as a standalone, test-oriented specification, and therefore adds: (i) an explicit locked numerical protocol/instantiation that turns the framework into computable outputs (V.A–V.B); (ii) a unified, analysis-ready Master Falsification Checklist with thresholds, channels, and what is being falsified (V.Z); (iii) invariance/sensitivity bookkeeping tables that separate microclass outputs from locked choices and calibrations (e.g., V.J.5); and (iv) explicit observational/experimental handle tables and analysis-ready waveform parametrizations to support direct confrontation with data (e.g., V.G.15).

REPLICABILITY NOTE (minimal artifacts per key result; even if not yet bundled).
The intent is that a reader can reproduce every “numbers on the page” result from a minimal, explicitly enumerated artifact set. Where an artifact is not yet bundled in this project, we still list it as required so the gap is unambiguous.

R1. Spectral-dimension / discontinuity module (d_s(ℓ), (ℓ*,Δd_s), κ) (V.B; V.G; V.J).
Minimal artifacts required:
• Input identity: the exact graph/operator definition used (adjacency/weights W and Laplacian convention L), or the full primitive specification (𝒦, K(u,v), ρ_𝒦(u), Π(·|u;θ), ν_Θ) plus the rule that constructs L_ρ (and any normalization conventions).
• Code module(s): PCT/pct_ds.py (d_s(ℓ) computation) plus any script that constructs W/L from the chosen (K,Π,ρ_𝒦) instantiation.
• Configuration: a single config file (or explicit parameter table) containing all locked knobs (e.g., N_𝒦, N_𝓜, σ_Π, η*, ρ̄_crit, ε, estimator choice, ℓ-grid, smoothing/differentiation settings).
• Randomness control: fixed RNG seed(s) for any stochastic trace estimator (Hutchinson), any sampling of 𝒦/θ, and any bootstrap/jackknife used to estimate uncertainties.
• Environment: Python version and key dependencies (NumPy/SciPy; plus any linear-algebra backend choices that affect reproducibility), and the numerical precision mode (float64 assumed unless stated).

R2. GW ringdown change-point confrontation (Δln Z / ln B, κ posterior; Appendix C tables) (V.G.15; Appendix C).
Minimal artifacts required:
• Data IDs: the exact LVK open-data release identifier(s) and GPS segment start/stop per event×detector (Appendix C.1a).
• Preprocessing config: sampling rate, bandpass, notch list, tapering, and PSD estimation rule (including off-source segment definition) as explicit parameters.
• Code module(s): PCT/gw_change_point_pilot.py (pilot scaffold) plus the waveform/inference adapters actually used (e.g., the GR baseline model interface and the evidence computation engine).
• Randomness control: fixed RNG seed(s) for samplers (MCMC/nested sampling), any injection campaigns, and any time-slide selection used in null controls.
• Runtime environment notes: Python version, sampler library versions (e.g., bilby/dynesty if used), and any detector-response/PSD tooling versions.

R3. CMB running capsule (executed posterior for dn_s/d ln k) (V.M.4).
Minimal artifacts required:
• Data IDs: exact likelihood package/component identifiers used (Planck 2018 TT/TE/EE + low-ℓ + lensing) and any accompanying nuisance/foreground model settings.
• Configuration: full parameter set, priors (especially running prior range), sampler settings, and convergence criteria (e.g., \hat R and ESS thresholds).
• Randomness control: fixed RNG seed(s) for the sampler.
• Runtime environment notes: exact inference stack versions (Boltzmann solver + likelihood code + sampler) and platform notes (OS/CPU) sufficient to explain any small numerical differences.

Scientific utility (what you can use this framework to answer).
This list states what the framework helps answer now (given what is actually specified/executed in v52), what it could answer with additional work, and what it explicitly does not address.

USE CASES & BENCHMARKS (CONCRETE TARGETS + MINIMAL REPRODUCIBLE WORKFLOW)

Purpose. This section is a practical bridge from “PCT primitives and discriminators” to executable work. Each use case below specifies: (i) a concrete experiment/survey/simulation setting, (ii) the distinct, testable output(s) PCT expects to produce, and (iii) a minimal, reproducible workflow to compute those outputs from well-defined inputs.

Notation. The key test-facing outputs are the spectral-dimension curve d_s(ℓ), the step diagnostics (ℓ*, Δd_s), and (when a horizon-scale proxy is defined in the same gated regime) κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H.

UC1 (SIMULATION BENCHMARK): weighted-graph / Laplacian surrogate → d_s(ℓ) and step test.
• Setting. Any simulation that yields a weighted adjacency W (or kernel-defined weights) on N nodes: random graphs, percolation near criticality, CDT/GFT-inspired graphs, analogue-horizon toy graphs, etc.
• Distinct output. A reproducible table/curve of P(ℓ)=Tr(exp(−ℓ^2 L)) and d_s(ℓ), plus an explicit step-vs-smooth decision using the step-fit vs smooth-fit models (IV.A.5a).
• Minimal workflow.
  1) Build W (symmetric, nonnegative weights); define a Laplacian L (record which convention: L=D−W or normalized).
  2) Choose a scale grid {ℓ_i} spanning the candidate transition window with resolution δℓ/ℓ* ≲ 0.1.
  3) Run the reference implementation to compute P(ℓ) and d_s(ℓ):
     python PCT/pct_ds.py
  4) Extract (ℓ*, Δd_s) using the fixed rule (V.G.5 / IV.A.5a) and report a step/non-step statistic (ΔAIC or equivalent).
  5) Required robustness controls: estimator swap (eig ↔ Hutchinson where applicable) + at least one refinement/size increase + a matched no-horizon/no-critical control run.

UC2 (ANALOGUE / LAB BENCHMARK): analogue horizon (BEC / optical lattice / cold-atom transport) → measured d_s(ℓ) step.
• Setting. Any platform where a return probability / diffusion proxy P(ℓ) can be measured (or inferred) as a function of diffusion scale and where a horizon-scale proxy r_H is operationally definable (e.g., analogue sonic/transport horizons).
• Distinct output. Empirical d_s(ℓ) curve with a statistically decidable “step vs smooth flow” conclusion; κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H reported as a dimensionless invariant (if r_H is defined in the same gated regime).
• Minimal workflow.
  1) Define the measured object: either P(ℓ) directly, or a data-derived operator L from which P(ℓ)=Tr(exp(−ℓ^2 L)) can be computed.
  2) Compute d_s(ℓ) and perform the step-vs-smooth model comparison (IV.A.5a).
  3) Run the required null control: remove the engineered gradient/“horizon” condition while keeping all estimator settings fixed; verify Δd_s≈0 in the control.

UC3 (OBSERVATIONAL BENCHMARK): GW ringdown change-point inference (LVK and beyond).
• Setting. Post-merger GW strain data for BBH ringdowns, analyzed with late-time-inclusive windows.
• Distinct output. Model comparison (Bayes factor / Δln Z) for a change-point residual vs GR-only, plus an inferred κ posterior that must be mass-independent and scale with r_+(M,a*) as t_c ∝ κ r_+/c (V.G.15; Appendix C).
• Minimal workflow.
  1) Acquire the ringdown-ready strain data and PSD for the chosen events (data provenance is recorded in Appendix C.1a).
  2) Run the change-point analysis scaffold:
     python PCT/gw_change_point_runner.py
     (or the pilot scaffold PCT/gw_change_point_pilot.py, depending on which is used for the capsule).
  3) Report per-event and stacked outputs exactly in the Appendix C table schema (C.5a), and calibrate the false-positive rate using GR-only injections and off-source time slides (Appendix C.6).

UC4 (SURVEY / INFERENCE BENCHMARK): CMB running dn_s/d ln k (Planck-like and next-gen likelihoods).
• Setting. CMB TT/TE/EE(+lensing) likelihood-based parameter inference for ΛCDM+running (with robustness extensions).
• Distinct output. Posterior for dn_s/d ln k and a pass/fail evaluation against the model-locked prediction band (V.M.4; falsifier F7).
• Minimal workflow.
  1) Run the inference capsule script (model-locked configuration; record the exact likelihood components and priors used in the run output):
     python PCT/planck2018_running_inference.py
  2) Report dn_s/d ln k posterior mean/median with 68% and 95% intervals, plus robustness shifts under {Ω_k, Σm_ν, N_eff} as specified in V.M.4.

UC5 (UNIT-TEST BENCHMARK): “no-horizon control” pair for the discontinuity module.
• Setting. A matched pair of numerical instances differing only in the near-horizon suppression mechanism (one engineered to produce a trapped/near-horizon region, one engineered not to).
• Distinct output. A single figure overlaying both d_s(ℓ) curves and a table reporting (ℓ*, Δd_s) in both cases, with Δd_s≈0 in the control (V.K.3a; V.Z F5–F6).
• Minimal workflow.
  1) Generate two operators/graphs (horizon vs no-horizon control) with identical size/discretization.
  2) Compute d_s(ℓ) for each using PCT/pct_ds.py, and apply the same step-extraction rule.
  3) Report the pass/fail criteria explicitly (DS-AC1–DS-AC3).

What it helps answer now (in this paper).
• How to go from pregeometric primitives (𝒦,K,Π,ν_Θ,ρ_𝒦) to explicit, computable θ-invariant outputs on 𝓜: (d_corr, g_μν proxies, v_char, V_{Π,out}, d_s(ℓ), κ, Δd_s) with regime gates and pass/fail diagnostics (Sections IV–V).
• How to state and audit falsifiable discriminators (and null controls) in a way that separates correspondence targets from evidential signatures (V.Z).
• How to implement and validate (at toy/in-silico level) the spectral-dimension computation pipeline (PCT/pct_ds.py; V.B/V.J).

What it might answer with additional work (not completed here).
• Whether the ringdown change-point discriminator is supported or ruled out by real LVK event-level inference once Appendix C’s pilot is executed (V.G.15; Appendix C; V.Z F1–F4).
• Whether the model-locked cosmology module’s running prediction is compatible with (or excluded by) a fully reproducible Planck-likelihood run and future CMB datasets (V.M.4; V.Z F7–F8).
• Whether a completed intrinsic dynamics/closure on (𝒦,K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ) exists that recovers GR dynamics (not just kinematics) and yields a principled matter-sector embedding (VI.A.0; roadmap items).

Research program (sequenced next steps; what each would establish).
(1) Theory: intrinsic dynamics + closure. Difficulty: High. Establishes whether the framework can be made fully predictive (a well-posed update law on (𝒦,K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ) and a sourcing/closure for ρ̄) rather than remaining kinematic/conditional.
(2) Computation: convergence + scheme-independence audit for the κ/Δd_s module. Difficulty: Medium–High. Establishes that the discontinuity is not a discretization/estimator artifact by demonstrating stable κ (and convergent Δd_s) across refinement, Laplacian choices, and estimator swaps under a fixed extraction rule.
(3) Data confrontation: execute the GW ringdown change-point pilot end-to-end. Difficulty: Medium. Establishes the first direct empirical pass/fail on the linked discriminator chain by filling Appendix C’s tables with event-level ln B and κ posteriors (plus null-control calibration).
(4) Data confrontation: execute the Planck 2018 running capsule exactly as specified. Difficulty: Medium. Establishes a reproducible posterior for dn_s/d ln k under a declared likelihood/priors, clarifying whether the model-locked band is already in tension with current CMB constraints.
(5) Cross-channel synthesis: joint-consistency / universality checks. Difficulty: Medium. Establishes whether inferred κ (from d_s(ℓ), ringdown, or analogue proxies) behaves as a dimensionless invariant across systems and whether the shared deformation-channel relations remain mutually consistent (V.Z, especially F3 and F10).

What it does not address (out of scope for v52; see also the checklist [NOT-1]–[NOT-6]).
• A full Standard Model embedding (gauge group, chiral fermions, anomaly cancellation, realistic matter content) beyond minimal toy bridges (see “Matter/unification roadmap”; [NOT-3]).
• A complete, unique UV completion with demonstrated regulator/scheme independence for all observables (beyond the scoped UV-consistency criterion used here; [NOT-4]).
• Practical forecasting/engineering/policy decisions; the work is a speculative fundamental-physics framework and is presented as a discriminator-first research programme, not an applied model ([NOT-6]).

Decision-relevant mapping (explicit non-claims; [NOT-6]). This work does not directly inform near-term policy or engineering decisions such as infrastructure design standards, safety limits, resource allocation, or operational forecasting, because it does not provide executed, validated empirical fits in those application domains and it does not deliver a decision-calibrated risk/benefit model. What it can inform only indirectly is *where to look* for discrimination: it motivates prioritizing observational channels and analysis features that are maximally sensitive to the paper’s explicit discriminators—most notably (i) late-time GW ringdown analyses that test for a change-point residual at t_c(M,a*) \propto \kappa r_+(M,a*)/c with the stated null controls, and (ii) analogue/graph-based measurements of scale-dependent diffusion/spectral dimension with resolution sufficient to decide “step vs smooth flow” and to extract \kappa \equiv \ell^*/r_H.

LIMITATIONS / OPEN PROBLEMS / DEGENERACY RISKS (READ BEFORE SECTION V)

DEGENERACIES: PLAUSIBLE MIMICS OF PCT SIGNATURES (AND HOW TO BREAK THEM)

Purpose. This section is a compact “degeneracy register”: alternative explanations (including mundane systematics) that can reproduce the *same apparent signature* as PCT, and the specific experimental/analysis knobs that must be turned to break each degeneracy. The point is not to claim uniqueness of PCT’s mechanism, but to make the discriminator logic auditable.

Scope note. These degeneracies are stated at the level of *observables* (θ-invariant reported outputs). They apply across the two primary discriminators (D1: d_s(ℓ) step / (κ,Δd_s) and D2: ringdown change-point) and the cosmology channel (D3: running). Each item below names (i) the mimic, (ii) what it can fake, and (iii) the knobs that should decisively separate it from PCT.

Degeneracy 1 — Finite-size / boundary-condition artifacts (spectral-dimension “step” mimic).
• What it mimics: an apparent non-analytic feature in d_s(ℓ) at finite ℓ, including an apparent “drop” that can look like a step when plotted on coarse ℓ-grids.
• Why it happens: finite systems generically show d_s(ℓ) → 0 at large ℓ (saturation). Transitions between pre-asymptotic scaling regimes can create sharp-looking features when d_s(ℓ) is estimated by numerical differentiation.
• Degeneracy-breaking knobs (required):
  (i) Refinement/size increase at fixed physical mapping (N_𝒦, N_𝓜 ↑) with the same extraction rule for (ℓ*,Δd_s): PCT requires κ band-level stability and nonzero limiting Δd_s; finite-size artifacts typically drift in ℓ* and shrink in Δd_s.
  (ii) Boundary-condition sweep: repeat with alternative boundary handling (periodic vs open vs absorbing boundaries, or graph boundary reweighting) while holding estimator settings fixed; finite-size/boundary mimics are boundary-sensitive.
  (iii) Pre-saturation window enforcement: declare a pre-saturation ℓ-window and show the “step” persists when the saturated tail is excluded.

Degeneracy 2 — Estimator / smoothing / derivative artifacts (spectral-dimension “step” mimic).
• What it mimics: a sharp discontinuity in d_s(ℓ) produced by numerical differentiation noise, smoothing window choices, or trace-estimator variance (especially when d_s is obtained from log-derivatives of a noisy P(ℓ)).
• Why it happens: d_s(ℓ) is a *derived* quantity (a derivative of ln P), so small biases in P(ℓ) or its smoothing can produce large localized changes in d_s(ℓ), including false steps.
• Degeneracy-breaking knobs (required):
  (i) Estimator swap: eigendecomposition ↔ Hutchinson (or independent Green-function/return-probability estimators where applicable) with matched uncertainty propagation; PCT requires consistent κ recovery.
  (ii) Smoothing/derivative-window sweep: change the log-slope window and/or smoothing kernel and show (ℓ*,Δd_s) are stable within stated tolerance.
  (iii) Step-vs-smooth model comparison with explicit penalty (ΔAIC or Bayes factor): visual “step-like” appearance must be supported by a quantitative preference that survives estimator swaps.

Degeneracy 3 — “No-horizon / no-critical” inhomogeneity (step mimic without trapped/near-horizon physics).
• What it mimics: a d_s(ℓ) step that is actually driven by generic inhomogeneity (or modular/community structure in a graph) rather than by the specific PCT near-horizon projection-collapse mechanism.
• Why it happens: heterogeneous weights or multi-community graphs can exhibit multi-scaling diffusion behavior with crossovers that look step-like, even when there is no operationally defined trapped region and no outward-compatibility collapse.
• Degeneracy-breaking knobs (required):
  (i) Matched “no-horizon/no-critical” control pair: remove the engineered trapped/critical region while keeping size, estimator settings, and global inhomogeneity level matched. PCT requires Δd_s≈0 in the control.
  (ii) Independent near-horizon diagnostics: require V_{Π,out} suppression and v_char/c suppression in the same domain where the step is claimed; otherwise the step is not licensed as a near-horizon discriminator.

Degeneracy 4 — Ringdown systematics (late-time change-point mimic).
• What it mimics: an apparent late-time change-point residual in ringdown that “turns on” after some time, potentially yielding a κ-like parameter when mapped back to t_c.
• Likely sources: waveform modeling systematics (overtone content, mode mixing, start-time choice), detector glitches, calibration drift, PSD misestimation, and windowing/taper artifacts.
• Degeneracy-breaking knobs (required):
  (i) Start-time marginalization and windowing sweeps: κ posterior must remain stable under reasonable π(t_0) changes and different tapers.
  (ii) Multi-detector consistency: t_c (and inferred κ) must agree across detectors for the same event; a glitch-driven mimic is typically detector-specific.
  (iii) Null controls: off-source time slides and GR-only injections must calibrate a low false-positive exceedance rate for ln B.
  (iv) Universality: κ must be dimensionless and consistent across events after scaling by r_+(M,a*); systematics typically produce analysis-window dependence rather than a mass/spin-scaled invariant.

Degeneracy 5 — Cosmology degeneracies (running mimic).
• What it mimics: an apparent negative running dn_s/d ln k at the ~10^{-2} level consistent with the PCT model-locked band.
• Likely sources: foreground/beam/systematic modeling, and parameter degeneracies in extended ΛCDM (Ω_k, Σm_ν, N_eff), plus inflationary-feature models that produce localized running-like behavior.
• Degeneracy-breaking knobs (required):
  (i) Likelihood-component stability: repeat with TT-only vs TT+TE+EE, and with/without lensing; running that is driven by a single component is suspect.
  (ii) Extended-parameter robustness: rerun allowing Ω_k, Σm_ν, N_eff and require sign/magnitude stability.
  (iii) Pattern-level check: require the correlated (running, r) pattern the module predicts (enhanced negative running with suppressed r), not only a single-number match.

Minimal reporting requirement (for any claimed discriminator pass/fail).
Any future subsection claiming “PCT is supported/ruled out” in a channel must explicitly state which degeneracy controls above were executed (with what knobs and what outcomes), and must state whether the matched control configurations returned null as required.

BOXED STATUS STATEMENT (PROVEN vs CHECKED NUMERICS vs CONJECTURE)

This paper uses three non-overlapping status labels. The goal is to prevent over-reading.

(1) PROVEN RESULTS (conditional theorems).
These are mathematical statements proven under explicit hypotheses (microclass axioms, regularity, and scope gates); they are not empirical support.
• Theorem 4 (continuum-limit convergence) and Theorem 5 (correlator-distance metric reconstruction), conditional on their stated assumptions.
• “Microcausality as admissibility” statements are derivations at the effective-description level once BC2 (hyperbolicity) is imposed as a gate.

(2) CHECKED NUMERICS (executed computations in this manuscript).
These are computations executed for the stated toy/in-silico protocols; they establish computability and provide sanity checks, but they are not direct empirical confrontation.
• The in-silico/toy spectral-dimension pipeline outputs in V.B (example d_s(ℓ), horizon indicators, proxy scalings).
• Refinement/robustness checks for the discontinuity module reported in V.J (e.g., convergence behavior of Δd_s and band-level stability of κ as stated there).

(3) CONJECTURES / OPEN CLAIMS (not proven here; not executed empirically here).
These are either explicitly labeled conjectures or claims that require missing ingredients (notably intrinsic dynamics) and/or real-data confrontation.
• Existence/uniqueness of an intrinsic dynamics/closure on (𝒦,K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ) sufficient to recover GR dynamics (VI.A.0; C7 is labeled CONJECTURE).
• Any empirical-support claim for GW ringdown and CMB channels until Appendix C and the V.M.4 inference capsule are executed (tables are explicitly marked TBD).

This manuscript is intentionally kinematic-first and discriminator-first. The point of this box is readability: it is a compact “ledger” of what is missing, what is fixed by hand, and what can be degenerate with other theories/systematics.

Quick status legend.
• NOT DERIVED = not yet obtained from the primitives + microclass axioms; an open problem.
• LOCKED = fixed to make one reproducible numerical instantiation; alternative admissible choices define different PCT variants.
• CALIBRATED = set by correspondence to known physics; success is necessary but not confirmatory.
• DISCRIMINATOR = could fail empirically and would carry evidential weight if detected.

CONSISTENCY RISK REGISTER (internal contradictions + enforcement locations)

This register lists the highest-risk internal contradictions in PCT-as-presented-here and how they are prevented. Each item includes a one-line mitigation and the exact enforcement location(s) (so a reader can audit the manuscript).

| Risk (potential contradiction) | What could go wrong (one line) | Mitigation (one line) | Enforced in (exact section(s)) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Metric disambiguation (g^{(E)} vs g^{(L)}) | Treat the correlator-distance metric g^{(E)}_{\mu\nu} (Riemannian reconstruction) as if it were the causal-cone proxy metric g^{(L)}_{\mu\nu} (Lorentzian), causing sign/causality errors and invalid GR-language inferences. | Hard-split the two metrics and forbid “transfer” statements unless BC gates (BC1–BC5), region Ω, and scale window [ℓ_0,ℓ_1] are explicitly stated in that subsection. | Theorem 5 “Convention enforcement (no transfer without gates)” (III.D.6); Definition III.F.8 (cone proxy metric); BC checklist + “OPERATIONAL ‘APPLIES WHEN…’ CONDITIONS”; Section IV.B scope gate. |
| Horizon/exterior consistency (BC2 + horizon module) | Use horizon language where the exterior fails admissibility (BC2), leading to an ill-posed cone structure (no meaningful v_char) or a “horizon” defined without an admissible outward notion. | Require BC2 (Z_t>0, Z_s>0 on Ω_ext) for any horizon/cone claim; define the horizon operationally via ε_out-thresholded Θ_out and V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}} so “outward” is well-defined only in the admissible exterior. | Section IV.D scope gate; Definitions III.F.4–III.F.7 (Θ_out, V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}, horizon proxy); IV.D.1–IV.D.2 (eqIV.D.3–eqIV.D.5); Worked example IV.D.8 (explicit exterior admissibility checks). |
| Gate ordering / scope violations (GR/QFT language before gates) | Introduce GR/QFT language (metric, horizons, commutators) without first stating which BC items passed on which (Ω,[ℓ_0,ℓ_1]), making claims unfalsifiable or internally inconsistent across regimes. | Impose a uniform scope-gate rule: any GR/QFT-language claim must report BC pass/fail plus (Ω,[ℓ_0,ℓ_1]); otherwise the claim is out of scope by definition. | Section I “Scope gate (interpretation convention for Sections I–III)”; Definition III.F.2 (gate as predicate + interpretation rule); “OPERATIONAL ‘APPLIES WHEN…’ CONDITIONS” (reporting requirement); Section IV.A/IV.B/IV.C/IV.D scope-gate headers. |
| Notation drift (C vs 𝒦; M vs 𝓜; Λ vs ν_Θ; inconsistent symbols) | Use the same symbol for different objects (or different symbols for the same object) across sections, causing silent substitution errors in derivations and in “where enforced” cross-references. | Declare canonical symbols and explicitly retire legacy shorthands; add explicit “notation consistency” notes at the first drift-prone locations. | IV.A.1 Notation note (C ≡ 𝒦; use 𝒦 exclusively thereafter); Appendix A (core symbols); Λ constraints block (Λ ≡ ν_Θ); RESULTS / CONTRIBUTIONS primitives list (𝒦, K, Π, Λ≡ν_Θ, ρ_𝒦). |

A. “Not yet derived” (missing theoretical ingredients).
• Intrinsic micro-dynamics: no unique update law on (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦, Π, Λ) is specified; results are conditional on microclass membership and admissibility (NOT DERIVED; VI.A.0).
• Full GR dynamics: Einstein’s field equations are not derived; this manuscript establishes kinematic correspondence (cone structure + weak-field redshift proxy) plus an operational horizon module (NOT DERIVED; IV.E.3; VI.A).
• Full interacting QFT / Standard Model: gauge structure, particle content, and renormalization are outside scope (NOT DERIVED).

A.1a Matter/SM embedding (explicit definition + minimal toy embedding + open problems).

Status in v52 (explicit).
A Standard Model (SM) embedding is NOT PROVIDED in this manuscript (see [NOT-3]). The only matter-facing content currently given is the IR/QFT bridge in IV.E.5 (sector-specific induced correlator and toy matter operators such as L_φ and the optional Dirac action), intended as an existence-proof that “QFT-like propagation” can be represented within the PCT primitives.

A.1a.1 What counts as an “embedding” in PCT (definition).
We say that a matter-sector theory T_matter is “embedded” in PCT (in the limited, operational sense used in this manuscript) if there exists a regime-gated patch (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) on which BC1–BC2 pass and a construction map:

  \mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{matter}} : (𝒦,K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ) \mapsto (G,\ \{\psi_a\},\ \{\mathcal{R}_a\},\ A^A_\mu,\ g_{\mathrm{eff}},\ \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{eff}})

such that the resulting effective description on 𝓜 contains:
(i) a compact gauge group G (at minimum a non-abelian factor),
(ii) a set of matter fields \{\psi_a\} transforming in specified representations \{\mathcal{R}_a\} of G (including at least one chiral multiplet if “SM-like” is claimed),
(iii) a gauge connection A^A_\mu (or equivalent parallel-transport data) on Ω,
(iv) an effective action/Lagrangian density \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{eff}} on (Ω,g_{\mathrm{eff}}) whose leading IR terms reduce to a local gauge theory (Yang–Mills + minimally coupled fermions/scalars) up to explicitly stated higher-order corrections,
(v) an explicit identification of which parts are (a) derived from PCT primitives, (b) locked choices defining a PCT variant, and (c) correspondence calibrations.

In this paper, “embedding” is therefore not “we can talk about particles,” but “we can construct a gauge+matter EFT on 𝓜 with a clear, auditable map from the pregeometric primitives.”

A.1a.2 Minimal toy embedding (one explicit example; not SM, but gauge+matter present).
Scope gate. This toy embedding is asserted only on an IR/QFT-like patch where BC1–BC2 pass and BC5 holds (slowly varying ρ̄).

Toy gauge group and representations.
• Gauge group: G_toy := SU(2)×U(1).
• Matter content (minimal, illustrative):
  – One left-handed Weyl doublet L in (\mathbf{2},\ +1/2),
  – One right-handed Weyl singlet e_R in (\mathbf{1},\ +1),
  – One complex scalar Higgs-like doublet H in (\mathbf{2},\ +1/2).
(This mirrors the SM electroweak pattern but omits color and families; it is only a “presence proof” that chiral gauge structure can be represented in the PCT mapping.)

Where the gauge data come from in PCT (mechanism sketch made explicit).
To represent internal gauge structure within the PCT primitive data, introduce a sector-refined projection kernel with internal indices and a sector-refined kernel:
• Replace Π(x|u;θ) by Π_i(x|u;θ) with i an “internal” index (i=1,2 for an SU(2) doublet sector).
• Replace the scalar compatibility kernel K(u,v) by a matrix-valued kernel K_{ij}(u,v) (Hermitian PSD as a kernel operator on the internal space) for the matter sector, while keeping the geometry-seed kernel K used for reconstruction as the trace/sector-average (so the gravity reconstruction module is not automatically altered).

In an IR patch where an effective notion of locality exists, define the emergent gauge connection as the (logarithmic) relative transport needed to compare internal fibers between nearby emergent points:
  U(x\to x+dx) := \mathrm{argmin}_{U\in G_toy}\ \|\,K_{ij}(u_x,u_{x+dx}) - U_i{}^k\,K_{kj}(u_x,u_x)\,\|,
and set (in the usual way) U(x\to x+dx) = \exp(i A_\mu(x) dx^\mu).
Interpretation: local gauge redundancy is the freedom to choose an internal basis of the sector-refined feature map (equivalently, to apply a local unitary on the internal index that leaves all PCT-observable θ-invariant quantities unchanged).

Effective interaction/coupling map.
Once g^{(L)}_{\mu\nu} is defined by the gravity channel (BC2; Definition III.F.8), define the minimal IR effective Lagrangian on Ω:
  \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{eff}} := -\frac{1}{4}F^A_{\mu\nu}F^{A\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{4}B_{\mu\nu}B^{\mu\nu}
  + i\,\bar{L}\,\bar{\sigma}^\mu D_\mu L + i\,\bar{e}_R\,\bar{\sigma}^\mu D_\mu e_R
  + |D_\mu H|^2 - V(H) - y\, e_R H^\dagger L + \mathrm{h.c.},
with covariant derivative D_\mu = \nabla_\mu + i g W^A_\mu T^A + i g' Y B_\mu.

PCT-to-EFT coupling identification (explicit).
In this toy embedding, the map from PCT primitives to EFT couplings is:
• Gauge connection A_\mu (and thus field strengths F_{\mu\nu}) is extracted from local internal transport defined by K_{ij} (as above) plus the reconstruction patch coordinates on Ω.
• Coupling constants (g,g',y) are treated as emergent/renormalized parameters that depend on the microclass/renormalization scheme and may depend on (μ,ρ̄) in the sense of IV.E.22–IV.E.24; they are not fixed in v52.
• The gravity-sector cone deformation (Z_t,Z_s) defines g^{(L)}_{\mu\nu}; this is the only coupling of matter to “gravity” in the toy IR action (no separate metric postulate).

A.1a.3 Open problems / unknowns (concrete; numbered).
(1) Gauge symmetry emergence (principled origin).
Give a principled criterion (beyond “assume a matrix-valued kernel”) selecting which internal symmetry group G is realized (why SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) specifically), and whether it is exact or approximate in the IR patch.

(2) Chirality and family replication.
Provide an explicit chiral fermion construction on (Ω,g^{(L)}_{\mu\nu}) tied to PCT primitives (e.g., an index/topology mechanism) and explain why three generations appear (or why they need not).

(3) Anomaly cancellation.
Show that the emergent fermion content is anomaly-free (or provide a selection/admissibility principle that enforces anomaly cancellation automatically) for the realized group and representations.

(4) Coupling normalization and running.
Derive (or tightly constrain) the renormalized couplings and their running from the underlying (𝒦,K_{ij},Π_i,ν_Θ) plus the UV/refinement scheme, beyond the schematic environment-dependent running channel of IV.E.5.

(5) Color sector (SU(3)) and confinement.
Extend the toy mechanism to include an SU(3) sector and explain how confinement/IR QCD emerges (including what observable on 𝓜 would diagnose confinement in PCT-native terms).

(6) Yukawas, flavor, and mass hierarchies.
Provide an account of Yukawa structure (why observed hierarchies), neutrino masses (Dirac vs Majorana), and mixing matrices, and identify which parts would be “locked” vs derived.

(7) Higgs sector naturalness and symmetry breaking.
Explain how symmetry breaking (or an effective Higgs phase) arises in the PCT mapping, what sets the Higgs potential V(H), and whether the hierarchy problem is addressed or simply translated.

(8) Backreaction / sourcing of ρ̄ by matter.
Provide a closure/source rule linking matter stress-energy (or PCT-native matter observables) to ρ̄ (and thus to Z_t,Z_s), so that gravity+matter is a coupled system rather than “matter on a fixed reconstructed background” (open dynamics problem VI.A.0).

(9) Universality / equivalence principle.
Demonstrate that all matter representations couple universally to the same gravity-channel deformation (or, if non-universal couplings occur, specify the predicted equivalence-principle violations and their regime gates).

(10) Regulator/scheme independence.
Show that the embedding does not depend pathologically on discretization/estimator choices: gauge observables and low-energy spectra should be stable under refinement and admissible scheme swaps, analogous to the κ/Δd_s robustness requirements (V.J).

Bottom line.
This manuscript provides the reconstruction machinery and a minimal IR/QFT bridge, but not a completed SM embedding. The toy embedding above is presented only to make explicit what the missing ingredients would have to look like in PCT-native terms.

B. “Put in by hand” (declared; not counted as confirmation).
• Weak-field mapping f(ρ̄) ↔ r_s/r (equivalently Newton’s G): imposed to match GR in the IR (CALIBRATED; V.D).
• Canonical instantiation choices: Π-family/width (σ_Π), kernel family/selection rule, deformation ansatz Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄) (LOCKED; V.A).
• Thermodynamic normalizations (e.g., η in S = ηA/(4ℓ_P²)) unless explicitly derived (CALIBRATED/CONVENTION; V.V).

Practical deliverables (useful even if PCT is falsified).
(1) Reusable artifact (minimal, self-contained): spectral dimension from a graph Laplacian.
The project file PCT/pct_ds.py is a standalone reference implementation that computes a spectral-dimension curve d_s(ℓ) from a weighted graph Laplacian (or kernel-defined adjacency), together with basic diagnostics that are useful beyond PCT.

What it provides (reusable outputs).
• P(ℓ) = Tr(exp(−ℓ² L)) over a user-specified scale grid {ℓ_i}.
• d_s(ℓ) computed as a log-derivative of P(ℓ).
• Estimator swap: exact eigendecomposition (“eig”) for small graphs and Hutchinson trace estimation (“hutch”) for larger graphs.
• A minimal refinement/coarsening diagnostic that reports max |Δ d_s(ℓ)| under a simple coarsening map.

How to run (fixed-seed demo; produces a reusable table you can adapt).
Run the script directly (it includes a tiny demo in __main__):
  python PCT/pct_ds.py

Expected outputs.
• A printed table: ell, P(ell), d_s(ell).
• A printed refinement diagnostic line: max |Δ d_s|.

Scope/robustness note.
This artifact is intentionally independent of any PCT-specific model claim: it is a generic “graph/Laplacian → d_s(ℓ)” computation + diagnostics module that can be reused for analogue-gravity planning, in-silico tests, or any project needing an auditable spectral-dimension pipeline.

Practical implications (actionable near-term outputs; clearly separated from speculative items).
The theory claims in this manuscript are speculative; however, several outputs are useful and executable on near-term timelines regardless of whether PCT is ultimately supported.

Near-term (deliverables you can ship on a concrete schedule).
• Deliverable D-PI1 (0–2 weeks): Release a “spectral-dimension toolkit” bundle.
  – Contents: PCT/pct_ds.py + one minimal config file + fixed-seed demo run that reproduces one published table of (ℓ, P(ℓ), d_s(ℓ)), plus estimator-swap (eig vs Hutchinson) and a single refinement/coarsening check.
  – Output: a reproducible d_s(ℓ) curve and a small stability report (max |Δd_s| under swap/refinement).

• Deliverable D-PI2 (2–6 weeks): Execute one fully specified in-silico benchmark test pair (“horizon” vs “no-horizon” control).
  – Contents: a script that generates two graph/operator instances differing only by the engineered near-horizon suppression, then runs the same d_s(ℓ) pipeline.
  – Output: a single figure overlaying the two d_s(ℓ) curves + a table reporting (ℓ*, Δd_s) with uncertainty for both cases, demonstrating Δd_s≈0 in the control.

• Deliverable D-PI3 (6–12 weeks): Produce a public, analysis-ready benchmark report for the GW change-point module.
  – Contents: fill Appendix C’s provenance ledger (Table C.1a) for a small pilot event list, lock the preprocessing choices, and run the pipeline end-to-end to populate Appendix C’s compact results table (Table C.5a), including null-control calibration tables.
  – Output: per-event and stacked (Δln Z, ln B, κ posterior summaries) plus the explicitly reported false-positive calibration threshold.

(See Appendix B: “Speculation / non-claims” for longer-horizon research directions and explicit out-of-scope items.)

(2) Decision-relevant mapping (non-policy claim).
This work does not directly inform near-term policy/engineering decisions such as infrastructure design standards, safety limits, resource allocation, or operational forecasting, because it is a speculative fundamental-physics framework without executed empirical confrontation in the target channels. What it can inform (indirectly) is prioritization of observational discrimination channels and analysis features: (i) late-time GW ringdown analyses that explicitly test for change-point structure at t_c(M,a*) ∝ κ r_+(M,a*)/c (with null controls), and (ii) analogue/graph-based measurements of scale-dependent diffusion/spectral dimension with resolution sufficient to test for a step vs smooth flow.

C. “What could be degenerate” (and what breaks the degeneracy).
• GW ringdown change-point: could be mimicked by waveform modeling systematics, start-time choices, calibration drift, or glitches. Degeneracy-breakers are built into the claim: κ must be a mass-independent dimensionless invariant and must scale with r_+(a*) across events, pass multi-detector consistency, and pass off-source null tests (V.G.15; V.Z F1–F4).
• CMB running: could be mimicked by foreground/systematic modeling and extended-parameter degeneracies (Σm_ν, $N_\mathrm{eff}$, curvature). Degeneracy-breaker is the correlated pattern (enhanced negative running + suppressed r) and robustness under extended parameter sets (V.M; V.Z F7–F8).
• “Cannot mimic” statements: any “GR+EFT cannot mimic the discontinuity” claim is always conditional on explicit baseline assumptions (A1–A6 in V.G.2). Relaxing those assumptions may allow mimicry but at the cost of adding an explicit nonlocal/threshold mechanism; this manuscript treats that as an accommodation-cost comparison, not a logical impossibility claim.

D. Minimal “status table” (what is being claimed at each layer).

| Item | Status | Where fixed/defined | What would count as failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| Weak-field redshift / PPN γ≈1 | CALIBRATED correspondence target | V.D | F9 (correspondence failure) |
| (κ, Δd_s) near-horizon d_s step | DISCRIMINATOR | V.G–V.J | F5–F6 (microclass discriminator fails) |
| Ringdown change-point (t_c, κ, ε_0) | DISCRIMINATOR | V.G.15; V.Z | F1–F4 (model preference / κ universality fails) |
| dn_s/d ln k running | DISCRIMINATOR (model-locked) | V.M | F7 (sign/magnitude exclusion) |
| Z_t–Z_s cross-observable relation | DISCRIMINATOR (consistency) | V.W; V.Z | F10 (joint-fit inconsistency) |

E. How to read claims.
• Correspondence matches are necessary consistency checks, not evidence.
• Only discriminator modules (with explicit falsifiers) are intended to carry evidential weight.

A more detailed ledger (with “what fails if violated”) is given in Section VI (Limitations/Open Problems) and in the Master Falsification Checklist (V.Z).

In Section II, we introduce the fundamental terms and definitions of correlation nodes, projections, and constraint manifolds. Section III formalizes the projection framework mathematically, and Section IV derives key results, including the emergence of Born probabilities and the correspondence with relativistic quantum field theory. Section V discusses implications for spacetime geometry, gravity, and black holes. Finally, Section VI summarizes conclusions and outlines directions for future investigation. 
Terminology note. Terms from general relativity—mass, horizon, curvature, redshift—appear in Sections I–IV to motivate the framework and connect to known physics. These are used anticipatorily: structures that will correspond to these concepts are derived in Section V from the pregeometric foundations. Until Section V, such terms should be read as "what GR calls X" rather than as assumptions built into PCT. 

Integration note (gravity sector). The project file PCT/gravity.researchpaper.txt is a companion “gravity-sector” writeup developed in the same notation family (projected environment field ρ̄, principal-symbol deformation, horizons as V_Π,out collapse, and leakage scalings). In v51, that material is integrated directly into Sections IV.B–IV.D and the closure/weak-field correspondence sketches in V.O, with two explicit alignment rules used throughout: (i) the companion paper’s pregeometric constraint set 𝓒 is identified here with 𝒦, and (ii) any single-scalar deformation Z(ρ̄) should be read as a matter-sector kinetic normalization (here denoted Z_φ) rather than as the gravity-sector cone-deforming channel (which is encoded by the anisotropic pair Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄)). 

Integration note (Hawking/leakage sector). The project files PCT/hawkingsradiation.researchpaper.txt and PCT/hawkingsradiation.txt are companion writeups focused specifically on horizon thermodynamics. Their content is integrated here mainly into Sections IV.D–V.C as (i) a compact “projection leakage” parametrization written in terms of a boundary steepness functional (a ρ̄-gradient at ∂B), (ii) a clear separation between “temperature scaling” (a surface-gravity-like proxy κ_PCT) and “escape amplitude” (V_Π,out suppression), and (iii) an explicit environment-dependence statement for the Hawking-scaling proxy expressed purely in PCT-native objects. Throughout this manuscript we keep notation consistent with the main PCT primitives: the companion papers’ 𝓒 is identified with 𝒦, and their density ρ_𝓒 on 𝓒 is identified with the projected environment field ρ̄(x;θ) on 𝓜.

Integration note (horizon-formation sector). The project file PCT/horizonformation.research.txt is a companion writeup that isolates the horizon criterion as a principal-symbol / characteristic-mode statement (“no outward-compatible modes”) and shows the equivalent projection-volume criterion (collapse of Θ_out and V_Π,out). Its content is integrated here mainly into IV.B–IV.D as (i) a clean mode-theoretic definition U_out(x) and its equivalence to the projection-volume definition, and (ii) an explicit statement that purely isotropic principal-symbol rescalings cannot, by themselves, produce true horizons—horizon formation requires anisotropic deformation so that the ratio Z_s/Z_t collapses.


MULTI-LEVEL STRUCTURE (MICRO / MESO / MACRO)

PCT is explicitly multi-level: (i) a micro-level of pregeometric correlation states on the constraint manifold 𝒦 (with kernel K and population ρ_𝒦); (ii) a meso-level of projection families and admissibility constraints (Π, Λ ≡ ν_Θ, microclass axioms, and operational admissibility such as microcausality and no-signaling); and (iii) a macro-level of effective spacetime/QFT/GR observables reconstructed on 𝓜 (metric g_μν, causal cones, horizons, spectral dimension, and correspondence-limit physics).

CORE CLAIMS (C1–C7): ONE-SENTENCE CLAIMS + DERIVATION MAPS

The items below provide a compact, uniform “spine” for the paper. Each claim is stated in one sentence, explicitly labeled by status, and accompanied by a one-line derivation map of the form (Inputs → Mechanism → Observable). Status labels are exhaustive and uniform: [THEOREM], [MODEL-LOCKED], [CONJECTURE]. Anything not fitting one of these labels is intentionally not a “core claim.”

KEY PROPOSITIONS (CRISP, TEST-FACING; MINIMAL DEPENDENCE DECLARATION)

To reduce “programmatic” phrasing, the core propositions are treated as conditional statements of the form:
(Assumptions / scope gate → mechanism statement → observable consequence), with an explicit tag indicating whether the proposition is microclass-level (variant-robust) or locked-instantiation-level (variant-dependent).

P1 [THEOREM; microclass-level]. If (𝒦,K,Π,Λ) ∈ 𝒨 and the smoothness conditions in III.D.6 hold, then correlator decay induces a well-defined correlation distance d_corr and a local metric reconstruction g_μν on any manifold-like patch (C1; Theorem 5; IV.A).

P2 [MODEL-LOCKED; admissibility-level]. If the induced principal symbol A^{μν} is hyperbolic (Z_t>0, Z_s>0 on Ω), then microcausality holds operationally: commutator support is restricted by the characteristic cones, and “no signaling outside cones” is an admissibility criterion rather than an independent postulate (C2; IV.B).

P3 [MODEL-LOCKED; discriminator-level]. In the locked instantiation (V.A), the near-horizon sector exhibits a non-analytic spectral-dimension step: there exists ℓ* such that d_s(ℓ) has a discontinuity at ℓ*, yielding the dimensionless invariant κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H (and Δd_s) as a falsifiable discriminator (C5; V.G–V.J).

P4 [MODEL-LOCKED; data-facing map]. If P3 holds, then a late-time ringdown change-point signature exists with scaling t_c(M,a*) ∝ κ r_+(M,a*)/c, providing an analysis-ready template family and null tests that do not rely on correspondence targets as evidence (C6; V.G.15; V.Z).

C1 [THEOREM; Section III.D.6 / Theorem 5]: Geometry (metric structure) on 𝓜 arises from correlator decay, via the correlation-distance metric reconstruction pipeline.
Derivation map: Inputs (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦, Π) → induced correlator G₂(x,y;θ) → correlation distance d_corr(x,y;θ) → local expansion → metric g_μν(x;θ).

C2 [MODEL-LOCKED; Section IV.B]: Microcausality is equivalent to admissibility of the induced principal symbol A^{μν} (hyperbolicity and well-defined characteristic cones) for the operator family L_ρ.
Derivation map: Inputs (G₂, Π, admissibility set A) → L_ρ = G₂^{-1} → principal symbol σ(L_ρ)=A^{μν}k_μk_ν → characteristic cones + commutator support.

C3 [MODEL-LOCKED; Sections IV.C and V.A.3]: Gravity is environment-driven deformation of maintainable correlations via ρ̄(x;θ) and anisotropic response functions Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄).
Derivation map: Inputs (ρ_𝒦, Π) → projected environment field ρ̄(x;θ) → deformation (Z_t,Z_s) → v_char(x), dτ/dt, and curvature/metric-proxy changes.

C4 [MODEL-LOCKED; Section IV.D]: Horizons are the collapse of outward-compatible projection volume V_Π,out(x) (equivalently, loss of outward-compatible characteristic modes).
Derivation map: Inputs (ρ̄, Z_t,Z_s, ν_Θ/w(θ|x)) → outward-admissible set Θ_out(x) → outward projection volume V_Π,out(x) → horizon boundary ∂B.

C5 [MODEL-LOCKED; Section V.G]: The near-horizon spectral dimension exhibits a discontinuous jump at ℓ* with predicted pair (κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H, Δd_s).
Derivation map: Inputs (kernel family, Π-width, microclass membership) → heat trace P(ℓ)=Tr[e^{−ℓ²L_ρ}] → spectral dimension d_s(ℓ) → discontinuity at ℓ* → (κ, Δd_s).

C6 [MODEL-LOCKED; Section V.G.10–V.G.15]: The discontinuity implies a late-time ringdown change-point signature parameterized by (κ, ε_0, τ_d) with scaling t_c(M,a*) ∝ κ r_+(M,a*)/c.
Derivation map: Inputs (κ, Δd_s, r_+) → effective operator step near r* → waveform change-point at t_c → ringdown residual template.

C7 [CONJECTURE; Sections V.O and VI.B]: A minimal intrinsic closure/dynamics exists that links matter sources to ρ̄ (and hence to Z_t,Z_s) and recovers GR dynamics in a controlled limit.
Derivation map: Inputs (ρ_mass or matter-sector data) → closure equation for ρ̄ → Z-deformation field → GR-like dynamics + PCT deviations.

ASSUMPTIONS & SCOPE (EXPLICIT)

This paper separates two kinds of assumptions:
(1) Mathematical regularity assumptions (required for measure-theoretic well-posedness and for theorem statements);
(2) Physical admissibility assumptions (required to interpret the emergent theory as a non-signaling, microcausal effective physics on 𝓜).

A. Microclass assumptions (required for “PCT-as-defined-here”): M1–M5 (Section III.E).
B. Continuum/regularity assumptions (required for theorems stated): smoothness/decay assumptions on K and induced G₂ (Sections III.D.4–III.D.6).
C. Physical admissibility assumptions (required for an acceptable emergent causal/operational theory): microcausality/admissibility of L_ρ (Section IV.B), no-signaling factorization conditions on Π (Section V.U), and record-stability/robustness criteria for measurement selection (Section V.T).
D. Correspondence calibrations (required to match known weak-field physics; not derived): mapping of f(ρ̄) to Newtonian potential / Schwarzschild redshift (Section V.D), and any entropy normalization convention (Section V.V).
E. Model-locked choices (used to generate numerical outputs/predictions; variant-dependent): Π-family and σ_Π, kernel family/selection rule (e.g., K_η with η*), and deformation ansatz Z_t,Z_s (Section V.A).

DOMAIN OF VALIDITY (EXPLICIT REGIMES)

Deep-UV statement (what level PCT lives at). PCT is intended as a deep-ultraviolet (deep-UV) theory in the following specific sense: its primitive degrees of freedom are pregeometric correlation/projection objects on (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦, Π, Λ), and the “spacetime/QFT/GR” description on 𝓜 is an emergent, regime-limited effective encoding that is only meaningful when the manifold-likeness and admissibility diagnostics pass. In this usage, “UV completion” does not mean “a quantization of a background metric,” but rather “a theory whose fundamental variables are defined without presupposing spacetime at all,” with GR/QFT recovered as an IR effective fixed point (correspondence target) on reconstructible patches.

UV-COMPLETENESS CLAIM (PRECISE SCOPE; WHAT IS / IS NOT CLAIMED)

This manuscript makes a *scoped* UV statement and does not claim a completed, unique UV theory of all interactions.

(1) Claim type (choose one; current status in v52).
• (i) Full UV completion: NOT CLAIMED.
• (ii) EFT with a controlled UV regulator: CLAIMED in the narrow, operational sense used here (explicit cutoff/refinement scale plus admissibility gates).
• (iii) Asymptotic safety / fixed-point scenario: NOT CLAIMED (no explicit beta functions / fixed-point demonstration is provided).

(2) Degrees of freedom (what is fundamental in this paper).
Primitive variables are (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦, Π, Λ≡ν_Θ). No metric field g_μν, matter fields, or SM gauge degrees of freedom are taken as fundamental.

(3) UV control parameters (what is actually being “taken to the UV”).
• A regulator/cutoff scale Λ (or equivalently a refinement parameter N for discrete realizations of 𝒦).
• In numerical contexts: (N_𝒦, N_𝓜) plus any declared kernel/projection resolution parameters that must be scaled with refinement (e.g., η*, σ_Π).

(4) Sense of “consistency” enforced in this manuscript (operational, not exhaustive).
• Unitarity: not derived as a fundamental S-matrix statement; instead a surrogate is enforced via admissibility/hyperbolicity (BC2) so that the induced effective dynamics is well-posed and does not permit acausal signaling.
• Locality/causality: emergent-only and gated; microcausality is imposed as an admissibility constraint on the induced generator (IV.B) rather than assumed as a spacetime axiom.
• Regulator independence: not established in full generality; stability under refinement and estimator swaps is required for reported θ-invariant observables (e.g., κ, Δd_s) (V.J; V.Z).
• Anomaly freedom: not addressed (no SM embedding or gauge-anomaly analysis in v52).

UV consistency hazards (ghosts/instabilities; surrogate conditions; status).
Because v52 uses induced/inferred operators (L_ρ, and in IV.E.5 an optional field-sector L_φ) rather than a canonical UV Lagrangian with manifest positivity, “UV consistency” must be treated as a set of *hazard checks* rather than as a proven property.

UV-consistency checklist (explicit; operational; v52 scope).
This checklist is the explicit “UV-consistency burden” for PCT as presented here. It is intentionally phrased as an auditable list of requirements, not as claims that they are already satisfied in full generality.

UV-1 Degrees of freedom in the UV (what are the high-energy variables?).
• Declare the primitive UV degrees of freedom to be exactly (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦, Π, ν_Θ≡Λ).
• State explicitly what is *not* a UV degree of freedom in this manuscript: no fundamental g_μν, no fundamental local matter fields, and no SM gauge representation content.
• Operational reporting: for any “UV-facing” computation, list the discretized state vector (e.g., sampled nodes u∈𝒦_N, kernel matrix K_N, projection weights Π_N, mediator weights ν_{Θ,N}, and population ρ_𝒦,N) whose size grows with refinement.

UV-2 Regulator/renormalization or discrete completion (how is the UV controlled?).
• Specify the UV control parameter: Λ→∞ (continuum language) or N→∞ with a_N→0 (discrete/refinement language).
• Specify which bare objects are allowed to run with the regulator: K_Λ (including kernel parameters such as η(Λ)), Π_Λ (including projection width σ_Π(Λ)), ν_{Θ,Λ}, and any normalizations Z(Λ).
• Operational requirement: identify a declared observable set {𝒪_j} (at minimum d_s(ℓ), ℓ*, κ, Δd_s when invoked) and demonstrate regulator stability to a stated tolerance over a UV window (V.J; V.Z).

UV-3 Anomaly/constraint closure (closure of the admissibility/constraint algebra).
• Constraint closure requirement: the admissibility constraints that define “PCT-as-an-operational-theory” must be mutually consistent under composition of preparations/transformations (OP1–OP6).
• Minimum checks required in v52:
  – Microclass closure: (K,Π,ν_Θ) remain in 𝒨 under the declared refinement/renormalization scheme (M1–M5).
  – No-signaling closure: the Π-factorization/no-signaling constraints (Λ-4; V.U) are stable under composition of local interventions (no setting-dependent marginals emerge under sequential application of admissible transformations).
  – Microcausality closure: the admissibility gate BC2 (hyperbolicity: Z_t>0, Z_s>0) is stable on the exterior region Ω_ext used for any causal/horizon claim.
• Scope note: gauge/matter anomalies in the SM sense are not analyzed in v52 because a full SM embedding is not provided (see A.1a.3).

UV-4 Unitarity / positivity conditions (what replaces “unitary UV QFT” here?).
Because PCT is not formulated here as a standard UV S-matrix QFT, v52 uses explicit surrogate conditions that are necessary for a well-posed, non-pathological effective description:
• Positivity of the primitive kernel: K symmetric PSD (M1).
• Positivity/stability of the diffusion/generator sector: the discrete L_ρ used for heat-trace diagnostics must have nonnegative spectrum (or otherwise generate a contractive semigroup so P(ℓ)=Tr[e^{−ℓ²L_ρ}] is well-defined).
• Hyperbolicity/microcausality gate: Z_t>0 and Z_s>0 on Ω whenever causal language is used (BC2).
• Positivity in any invoked matter-sector deformation: Z_φ(ρ̄)>0 if L_φ is used (IV.E.5).

UV-5 What “completion” means operationally for PCT (definition).
In this manuscript, “UV completion” is not “a local Lagrangian on a background manifold.” Operationally, PCT is “completed (in the strong sense)” only when all of the following are provided:
(i) A well-posed intrinsic update law on the primitives (K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ) in τ_int (VI.A.0),
(ii) A regulator/refinement scheme with demonstrated scheme-independence for a declared set of θ-invariant observables (not only κ, but a broader observable set),
(iii) A matter/gauge embedding with explicit anomaly/constraint closure checks (at minimum, a non-abelian gauge sector with anomaly cancellation in the IR patch), and
(iv) A correspondence regime in which GR+QFT are recovered as an IR effective description with clearly separated calibrations vs predictions.

Status note (v52). The present manuscript satisfies the *narrow* operational UV-control criterion stated earlier (explicit regulator/refinement language + stability checks for selected θ-invariant observables), but it does not claim items (i) and (iii) above.

(a) Potential ghost / instability channels (what could go wrong).
• Wrong-sign kinetic channel in an effective local expansion of L_ρ (or L_φ): would appear as negative-norm/ghost-like degrees of freedom in a mode decomposition.
• Tachyonic/instability channel: negative spectrum of the spatial generator (e.g., negative eigenvalues of a Laplacian-like operator), implying runaway growth in the corresponding heat/propagator semigroup.
• Non-hyperbolic/ill-posed propagation: loss of hyperbolicity of the principal symbol A^{μν} (equivalently Z_t≤0 or Z_s≤0) leading to acausal/ill-posed evolution (IV.B; BC2).
• Non-PSD kernel pathology: if the primitive kernel K ceases to be symmetric PSD (M1), induced correlators can lose positivity properties and reconstruction becomes non-physical.
• Regulator-induced artifacts: apparent stability/positivity at finite N that fails under refinement (e.g., spectra crossing into negative/complex values as N_𝒦→∞).

(b) Positivity/causality surrogate conditions required in v52 (what we actually enforce).
• Kernel positivity: K is symmetric PSD (M1) [ASSUMPTION at the primitive level; checked numerically in toy runs].
• Generator positivity (diffusion stability surrogate): L_ρ (in the discrete realization used for d_s(ℓ)) has nonnegative spectrum (or, minimally, generates a contractive semigroup so that Tr[e^{−ℓ²L_ρ}] is well-defined and nonincreasing in ℓ) [CHECKED in the in-silico runs used for V.B/V.G/V.J; not proven in general].
• Hyperbolicity / microcausality gate: Z_t>0 and Z_s>0 on the region Ω where a causal interpretation is made (BC2 / IV.B.19) [ASSUMPTION as a gating rule; checked in each reported run via m_t,m_s margins].
• Matter-sector well-posedness (if IV.E.5 is invoked): Z_φ(ρ̄)>0 (eqIV.E.21) [ASSUMPTION; no executed empirical check in v52].
• Regulator/scheme stability: θ-invariant UV-facing observables (at minimum κ, and a refinement-extrapolated Δd_s) should be stable under estimator and scheme changes (V.J.2a–V.J.2b) [CHECKED for κ at band level; Δd_s requires refinement extrapolation].

(c) Proven vs checked vs assumed (one-line ledger).
• Proven in v52: theorems are conditional—e.g., Theorem 5’s metric reconstruction and positivity statements hold under the stated smoothness/PSD assumptions; hyperbolicity implies well-posed characteristic cones at the effective level (IV.B) once BC2 is imposed.
• Empirically checked in v52: discrete refinement convergence of Δd_s toward a positive limit (V.J.2) and scheme-level robustness of κ (V.J.2b), plus explicit positivity-margin checks m_t,m_s>0 in the reported toy protocol.
• Remaining assumptions: full UV unitarity/ghost freedom beyond the surrogates above (no complete spectral-representation/positivity proof for continuum L_ρ; no full Källén–Lehmann-type positivity statement; no SM anomaly analysis).

One-sentence falsifier (UV consistency in this paper’s operational sense).
If, under refinement/scheme variation satisfying the stated scaling prescriptions, the induced operators fail the surrogate stability gates (e.g., BC2 fails in the claimed regime or L_ρ develops non-decaying/negative-spectrum behavior that breaks the heat-trace definition of d_s(ℓ)), then the manuscript’s scoped “UV consistency” claim fails for that instantiation.

Bottom line (one sentence). In v52, “UV completeness” is meant only as “pregeometric variables defined without presupposing spacetime + an explicit regulator/refinement framework with admissibility gates,” not as a demonstrated UV-fixed-point completion or full SM+gravity completion.

PCT is not presented as a single “always-on” effective description. Different parts of the formalism are intended to apply in different regimes, defined operationally by what is reconstructible on 𝓜 and by the behavior of d_s(ℓ), g_μν, and the admissibility/microclass conditions.

Regime I — IR classical regime (GR recovered).
• Defining condition: ρ̄ ≪ ρ̄_crit and a stable manifold-like window exists (IV.A.6), with an IR plateau d_s(ℓ) ≈ 4 over a broad scale range.
• Interpretation: 𝓜 admits an approximately smooth Lorentzian reconstruction (metric proxy well-behaved; hyperbolicity holds) and standard QFT-on-curved-background reasoning is approximately valid.
• Domain statement: PCT must reduce to GR/QFT correspondence targets here (weak-field redshift, causal cones, local propagation); any deviations are subleading and bounded by existing tests.

Regime II — Mesoscopic/near-critical regime (PCT deviations expected).
• Defining condition: ρ̄ is non-negligible and/or exhibits strong gradients, especially near trapped regions/horizons; d_s(ℓ) becomes scale-dependent and may exhibit the model-locked discontinuity at ℓ* (V.G).
• Interpretation: 𝓜 is still meaningful, but effective locality/continuum smoothness is limited; projection-volume effects, operator nonlocality, and discontinuous dimensional behavior can appear.
• Domain statement: This is the regime targeted for falsifiable deviations (κ, Δd_s, ringdown change-point, environment-dependent horizon scalings).

Regime III — UV / pregeometric regime (no manifold interpretation).
• Defining condition: below the smallest scale at which manifold-likeness criteria hold (IV.A.6), or when microclass/admissibility conditions fail (e.g., loss of C² regularity of G₂ near the diagonal, or loss of hyperbolicity/admissibility for L_ρ).
• Interpretation: 𝓜 should be treated as a label space only; geometric notions (metric, curvature, horizons) are not well-defined, and the correct description is directly on (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦, Π, Λ).
• Domain statement: In this regime, statements phrased in GR/QFT language are not meaningful; only pregeometric correlation/projection statements are.

OPERATIONAL “APPLIES WHEN…” CONDITIONS (PARAMETERS, DIAGNOSTICS, FAILURE MODES)

This checklist makes the regime boundaries above operational. It is not a new axiom set; it is a practical reporting layer specifying which computed diagnostics must pass before a GR/QFT-style interpretation is permitted.

BOUNDARY CONDITIONS CHECKLIST (ONE-PAGE; PASS/FAIL)

Use this box as the single “boundary conditions” summary. Any subsection that uses GR/QFT language must state which items (BC1–BC5) passed, on what region Ω, and on what scale window.

BC1 — Manifold reconstruction (local geometry permitted).
PASS if the manifold-likeness diagnostics of IV.A.6 are satisfied on Ω and |dx|≤ℓ:
• Quadratic residual: median_{x∈Ω} sup_{|dx|≤ℓ} R_quad(x;dx) ≤ ε_quad.
• Path additivity: median_{(x,y,z)∈patch} max(0,R_path) ≤ ε_path.
FAIL ⇒ treat 𝓜 as label space only (Regime III): do not interpret g_μν, curvature, horizons, or r_H.

BC2 — Causal admissibility (microcausality/hyperbolicity).
PASS if m_t := inf_{x∈Ω} Z_t(ρ̄(x;θ)) > 0 and m_s := inf_{x∈Ω} Z_s(ρ̄(x;θ)) > 0.
FAIL ⇒ excluded by construction (no well-posed emergent dynamics; no GR/QFT interpretation).

BC3 — Admissible kernel class (what kernels are excluded).
A kernel K is excluded (not in microclass 𝒨) if it violates any of:
• PSD/symmetry (M1): K is not symmetric PSD.
• Regularity/decay (M1 + III.D.4): K lacks the continuity/decay needed for RKHS and local expansions.
• Correlation-distance compatibility (M4): the induced d_corr fails to behave as a usable distance in the tested window.
• Spectral convergence (M5): d_s(ℓ) fails to admit a stable IR plateau/window in the tested refinement family.

BC4 — Admissible projection/mediator class (what Π/Λ are excluded).
A projection structure (Π, Λ≡ν_Θ) is excluded if it violates:
• Normalization/measurability (M2, Λ-1, Λ-2).
• No-signaling/factorization (Λ-4; V.U).
• Robustness/continuity of θ-invariants away from declared critical transitions (Λ-3).

BC5 — “Slowly varying ρ̄” (IR/QFT-like usage condition; what it means in practice).
In addition to ε_Z(x) := max(|Z_t(ρ̄(x))−1|, |Z_s(ρ̄(x))−1|), define a dimensionless gradient diagnostic over a chosen coarse-graining scale L:
  ε_∇(x;L) := L · |∇ ln(ρ̄(x)+ρ̄_floor)|, with ρ̄_floor > 0 a stated numerical floor.
IR/QFT-like usage is permitted only if median_{x∈Ω} ε_Z(x) ≤ ε_IR AND median_{x∈Ω} ε_∇(x;L_IR) ≤ ε_∇,IR for a stated L_IR.
FAIL ⇒ treat as Regime II (mesoscopic/near-critical): do not claim local QFT/GR correspondence in that region.

Notation. All thresholds below are dimensionless and should be evaluated on a specified target region Ω ⊂ 𝓜 and a specified scale window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁]. Recommended reporting: quote the window, the estimator used, and the observed max/median over Ω.

Default estimators (unless explicitly overridden in a subsection):
• “median over Ω” means the sample median over uniformly sampled x ∈ Ω (or over the discrete node set representing Ω in a numerical realization).
• “sup over |dx|≤ℓ” is evaluated by sampling a fixed displacement stencil of N_dir directions (recommended: N_dir ≥ 16) at radii |dx| ∈ {ℓ/4, ℓ/2, ℓ}.
• Derivatives used in diagnostics (e.g., ∂ρ̄/∂n) should be computed with the same discretization family used for L_ρ in that run (finite-difference / spectral / lattice estimator), and the choice must be stated.

(1) Manifold-likeness pass/fail (IV.A.6 made operational).
• Quadratic residual test: define the normalized residual
  R_quad(x;dx) := |d_corr(x,x+dx)^2 − g_μν(x)dx^μdx^ν| / |dx|^2.
  “Manifold-like at scale ℓ” means: for |dx| ≤ ℓ,
  median_{x∈Ω} sup_{|dx|≤ℓ} R_quad(x;dx) ≤ ε_quad,
  with a stated tolerance (e.g., ε_quad = 0.10 for “usable,” ε_quad = 0.03 for “precision”).
• Path additivity test: define
  R_path(x,y,z) := [d_corr(x,z) − d_corr(x,y) − d_corr(y,z)] / d_corr(x,z).
  “Locally additive” means: median_{(x,y,z)∈patch} max(0,R_path) ≤ ε_path (e.g., ε_path = 0.10).

Failure mode if violated: g_μν is not operationally meaningful; treat 𝓜 as a label space (Regime III).

(2) Microcausality / hyperbolicity pass/fail (IV.B made operational).
• Positivity margin: define
  m_t := inf_{x∈Ω} Z_t(ρ̄(x;θ)),   m_s := inf_{x∈Ω} Z_s(ρ̄(x;θ)).
  “Admissible causal sector” means: m_t > 0 and m_s > 0, with a reported safety margin (e.g., m_t,m_s ≥ 10^{-3} in the chosen units/normalization).
• Characteristic-speed collapse diagnostic: report v_char/c = √(Z_s/Z_t). A practical horizon-proximity diagnostic is
  h(x) := log10(v_char(x)/c).
  Values h(x) ≲ −3 indicate the regularized near-horizon limit already assumed elsewhere in the manuscript.

Failure mode if violated: loss of well-posed evolution / acausal support; the effective spacetime/QFT interpretation is excluded by construction.

(3) IR correspondence regime (QFT/GR-like usage conditions).
• “Weak deformation” condition (correspondence target only): define
  ε_Z(x) := max(|Z_t(ρ̄(x))−1|, |Z_s(ρ̄(x))−1|).
  “IR classical/field regime” means: median_{x∈Ω} ε_Z(x) ≤ ε_IR with a stated tolerance (e.g., ε_IR = 0.05).
• Spectral-dimension plateau condition: there exists a contiguous scale window [ℓ_a,ℓ_b] ⊂ [ℓ₀,ℓ₁] such that
  |d_s(ℓ) − 4| ≤ δ_IR for all ℓ ∈ [ℓ_a,ℓ_b] and the window width satisfies log(ℓ_b/ℓ_a) ≥ 1.
  (Recommended δ_IR: 0.2 for coarse “plateau present,” 0.05 for precision comparisons.)

Failure mode if violated: do not claim GR/QFT correspondence; instead report results as mesoscopic/near-critical (Regime II) outputs.

(4) Near-horizon / near-critical regime (where discriminator modules are allowed).
• “Near-horizon” here means not “at r=r_H” but “in a region where outward-compatibility is strongly suppressed.” Operationalize by requiring:
  V_Π,out(x) ≤ V_cut for x ∈ Ω_hor, with a stated threshold (e.g., V_cut = 0.1 in the manuscript’s V_Π,out normalization),
  AND simultaneously v_char/c ≤ ε_out (same ε_out used in IV.D.1).
• Discontinuity diagnostic: define Δd_s over a small bracket around the candidate ℓ*:
  Δd_s := d_s(ℓ*_−) − d_s(ℓ*_+), with ℓ*_− < ℓ* < ℓ*_+ chosen so that log(ℓ*_+/ℓ*_−) ≤ 0.2.
  Report both Δd_s and the stability of κ = ℓ*/r_H under refinement/perturbations (as already required in V.J).

Failure mode if violated: if the “near-horizon” diagnostics do not show suppression (V_Π,out not small and v_char not reduced), then applying the near-horizon discriminator template (κ, Δd_s, ringdown change-point) is not justified.

(5) INDEPENDENT VARIABLES / CONTROL VARIABLES (COMPACT VARIABLE SCHEMA)
This schema states what can be varied, what is held fixed in the locked instantiation, and what is derived. It is intended as a compact causal/functional map so that statements of the form “X changes Y” are always traceable to an explicit variable relationship.

Exogenous inputs (free within admissible microclass 𝒨; define a PCT variant):
• Kernel family K(u,v) (shape + decay structure; must satisfy M1).
• Constraint population ρ_𝒦(u) (including its gradients and any external-environment modification rules).
• Projection family Π(·|u;θ) and parameter space Θ (including any width/shape parameters such as σ_Π and any backbone map f_θ).
• Projection mediator Λ ≡ ν_Θ plus its admissibility constraints (Λ-1…Λ-5, plus no-signaling factorization conditions where applicable).

Locked-for-reproducibility control parameters (fixed choices inside one canonical instantiation; Section V.A):
• Π-family functional form + numerical σ_Π (eqV.A.1–eqV.A.2).
• Kernel selection rule and chosen kernel subfamily/parameter η* (eqV.A.4–eqV.A.6; Proposition 1).
• Deformation family Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄) (eqV.A.8), including any regularization ε.

Calibrated mappings (fit to correspondence targets; not predictions):
• Weak-field mapping f(ρ̄) ↔ Φ/c² (or equivalently f(ρ̄) ↔ r_s/r), which fixes the effective Newton coupling used in correspondence checks (V.D).
• Any entropy normalization convention (η in S = ηA/(4ℓ_P²); V.V).

Endogenous mediators (forced once exogenous inputs + admissibility are fixed):
• G₂(x,y;θ) (induced correlator) from (K, ρ_𝒦, Π, ν_Θ).
• ρ̄(x;θ) (projected environment field) from (ρ_𝒦, Π).
• L_ρ and its principal symbol A^{μν}(x) from (G₂, admissibility).
• Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄) once the deformation family is chosen/locked.

θ-invariant observables (reported outputs; used in falsification):

To avoid ambiguity, we classify reported θ-invariant “outputs” into: (i) primary discriminators (confirmatory if detected), (ii) secondary/diagnostic outputs (support interpretation and internal consistency), and (iii) correspondence targets (necessary consistency checks; not confirmatory).

Primary discriminator outputs (should be treated as the dependent variables for confirmation claims):
• Near-horizon discontinuity observables: κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H and Δd_s (V.G–V.J).
• GW change-point observables (derived from κ module): t_c(M,a*) scaling and the change-point residual template parameters (V.G.15; V.Z F1–F4).
• Cosmology discriminator (model-locked): dn_s/d ln k (and its correlated pattern with r) (V.M; V.Z F7–F8).
• Cross-observable consistency discriminator: joint (Z_t, Z_s/Z_t) consistency via v_char/c = √(Z_s) × (dτ/dt) (V.W; V.Z F10).

Secondary/diagnostic outputs (used to establish regime applicability and interpret the above):
• Geometry/metric proxy and distances: d_corr, g_μν (or proxy) from G₂.
• Causal sector diagnostics: v_char/c = √(Z_s/Z_t), horizon indicators (Θ_out, V_Π,out).
• Dimensional profile diagnostics: the full d_s(ℓ) curve (including plateau windows and estimator stability), not just (κ,Δd_s).

Correspondence targets (necessary but not confirmatory):
• Weak-field redshift/time dilation scaling once f(ρ̄) is calibrated (V.D).
• Minkowski/IR local-field limit (Z_t,Z_s → 1; d_s(ℓ) ≈ 4 plateau) in the appropriate regime.

IR CORRESPONDENCE CHECKLIST (A.3; IR RECOVERY OF GR+QFT) — COMPACT, AUDITABLE

Purpose (scope). This checklist is the minimum required to claim an “IR GR+QFT-like regime” on a declared patch (Ω,[ℓ_IR,0,ℓ_IR,1]). Passing the checklist is a *consistency gate* (necessary; not confirmatory). All items must be reported as pass/fail with the exact run ID/config.

(i) Explicit BC-pass requirements (must be stated before any IR claim).
Required gates (with where enforced in this manuscript):
• BC1 (manifold-likeness / distance interpretability) passes on (Ω,[ℓ_IR,0,ℓ_IR,1]) so d_corr and local reconstructions are meaningful.
• BC2 (admissibility / hyperbolicity) passes on Ω so characteristic cones and v_char are defined and microcausality language is licensed.
• BC3–BC5 (IR/QFT windowing gates) pass on (Ω,[ℓ_IR,0,ℓ_IR,1]) as *separate binary checks*:
  – BC3: IR locality / operator regularity (L_ρ behaves as a local, second-order-like generator over the IR window; no nonlocal tails large enough to spoil local propagation claims).
  – BC4: sector factorization / no-signaling discipline (the projection/matter-sector construction used in the claim obeys the stated factorization/admissibility constraints so “field sector” language is coherent).
  – BC5: slow-variation / EFT applicability (ρ̄ and the deformation channel are slowly varying on the IR window, so local expansion/EFT-style approximations are internally consistent).

Reporting rule. Any IR claim must include one line of the form:
  IR scope: Ω = ______ ; [ℓ_IR,0,ℓ_IR,1] = [____,____] ; BC1 = pass/fail ; BC2 = pass/fail ; BC3 = pass/fail ; BC4 = pass/fail ; BC5 = pass/fail.

(ii) Concrete IR targets (what must be numerically demonstrated from pipeline outputs).
On the stated (Ω,[ℓ_IR,0,ℓ_IR,1]), report the following numeric targets (with uncertainty, estimator choice, and at least one robustness swap when applicable):

T1) Spectral-dimension plateau target (IR dimensionality).
• Target: d_s(ℓ) exhibits an approximately constant plateau near 4 over a nontrivial IR window: 
  mean_{ℓ∈[ℓ_IR,0,ℓ_IR,1]} d_s(ℓ) = 4 ± δ_d  with δ_d stated (and stability under the stated estimator swap).
• Output used: d_s(ℓ) curve from the heat-trace module (IV.A; pct_ds.py).

T2) Local-propagation target (near-Minkowski cone and finite characteristic speed).
• Target: in the IR patch, the cone deformation is small and stable: Z_t(ρ̄) ≈ 1 and Z_s(ρ̄) ≈ 1 on Ω (or equivalently v_char/c = √(Z_s/Z_t) ≈ 1), with an explicit tolerance δ_v.
• Output used: Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄), and v_char/c on Ω (IV.B–IV.C).

T3) “No spurious discontinuity in the IR window” target (discriminator separation).
• Target: the step-detection protocol returns “smooth” (or Δd_s consistent with 0) when restricted to the IR window [ℓ_IR,0,ℓ_IR,1]; any detected step must lie outside the declared IR window.
• Output used: the step-vs-smooth decision statistic applied on the restricted window (IV.A.5a).

Spin-off methods note (general tool; not evidence for PCT). Independently of any QG interpretation, the spectral-dimension step-detection protocol used here (fit/decision on $d_s(\ell)$ computed from a heat trace $\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-\ell^2 L})$) can be read as a general change-point detector for *graphs/operators*: given any Laplacian-like or generator-like operator $L$ on a network, mesh, or state graph, it flags scale-localized structural transitions (step vs smooth-flow) in diffusion behavior. Potential non-QG application domains include: (i) time-evolving or multiplex networks (detecting regime changes in connectivity/transport by tracking $d_s(\ell)$ across snapshots); (ii) materials / porous media / random composites (identifying crossovers in effective transport dimension across length scales); and (iii) neuroscience connectomics or other biological interaction graphs (detecting multiscale modularity transitions via diffusion-based dimensional profiles). These uses are methodological spin-offs and should not be construed as empirical support for PCT’s gravitational claims.

T4) Correlator-to-local-field consistency target (optional but recommended).
• Target: when mapped to reconstructed distances, the induced correlator G₂(x,y) is well-fit by a standard IR ansatz on the patch (e.g., power-law/Green-function-like decay) within declared residual tolerance.
• Output used: G₂(x,y;θ) or θ-invariant summary vs reconstructed d_corr(x,y) on Ω (IV.A; IV.E).

(iii) Worked example (numerical verification from pipeline outputs).
This example shows exactly how the IR targets T1–T3 are verified from a single pipeline run. (The *procedure* is fixed; the reported numbers must be taken from the run’s logged outputs.)

Example run declaration.
• Run ID / config: IR-DEMO-1 (fill with the actual run label used in this manuscript’s artifact log).
• Patch and window: declare Ω and choose an IR window [ℓ_IR,0,ℓ_IR,1] that is (a) above the UV-regulator scale and (b) below finite-size saturation.

Step 1 — Verify BC pass/fail (scope license).
Record (BC1,BC2,BC3,BC4,BC5) as computed in the run’s gate module. If any required BC fails, stop: IR correspondence claims are out of scope for that run.

Step 2 — Verify T1 (d_s≈4 plateau).
From the d_s(ℓ) array on the chosen window, compute:
  \bar d_s := mean_{ℓ∈[ℓ_IR,0,ℓ_IR,1]} d_s(ℓ),\quad s_d := std_{ℓ∈[ℓ_IR,0,ℓ_IR,1]} d_s(ℓ).
Pass criterion (explicit): |\bar d_s − 4| ≤ δ_d  and  s_d ≤ s_{d,\max}, with (δ_d, s_{d,\max}) stated in the run header.

Step 3 — Verify T2 (local propagation / near-Minkowski cones).
On the same Ω, compute:
  \bar v := mean_{x∈Ω} v_{\mathrm{char}}(x)/c,\quad s_v := std_{x∈Ω} v_{\mathrm{char}}(x)/c.
Pass criterion (explicit): |\bar v − 1| ≤ δ_v  and  s_v ≤ s_{v,\max}, with (δ_v, s_{v,\max}) stated.
(Equivalently report Z_t and Z_s summaries if v_char is not directly logged.)

Step 4 — Verify T3 (no IR-window step).
Rerun the step-vs-smooth protocol restricted to [ℓ_IR,0,ℓ_IR,1].
Pass criterion (explicit): the decision is “smooth” at the stated threshold OR the fitted Δd_s is consistent with 0 within uncertainty on that restricted window.

Minimal “what moves what” chain (single-line):
(K, ρ_𝒦, Π, ν_Θ) → (G₂, ρ̄) → (L_ρ, A^{μν}) → (g_μν proxy, v_char, V_Π,out, d_s(ℓ)) → (κ, Δd_s; ringdown/cosmology templates).

STRUCTURAL-EQUATIONS SUMMARY (MINIMAL; DEFINITIONS ONLY)
The dependence structure used throughout the paper can be summarized as:

(E1) G₂ = G₂[K, ρ_𝒦, Π, ν_Θ]  (definition eqIV.A.1 / item (8) in “MINIMAL FORMAL CORE”).
(E2) ρ̄ = ρ̄[ρ_𝒦, Π]  (definition eqIV.C.2).
(E3) L_ρ = G₂^{-1}  (definition eqIV.A.5 / item (10) in “MINIMAL FORMAL CORE”).
(E4) A^{μν} = A^{μν}[ρ̄; Z_t(·), Z_s(·)]  (definitions eqIV.C.4–eqIV.C.5).
(E5) v_char/c = √(Z_s/Z_t)  (definition eqIV.B.1(E6) d_s(ℓ) = −2 ∂ ln Tr(e^{−ℓ² L_ρ}) / ∂ ln(ℓ²)  (definition eqIV.A.7).

INTERVENTION-STYLE CLARIFICATION (WHAT COUNTS AS A PHYSICAL “CONTROL”)
• Changing the projection gauge parameter θ alone is not a physical intervention: θ is declared gauge (V.S), and θ-invariant observables must be unchanged under θ-reparameterization.
• Physical model variation (“intervention” in the sense of comparing variants) occurs by changing one of the exogenous inputs (K, ρ_𝒦, Π-family, ν_Θ) within admissibility, which then propagates through (E1)–(E6) to change θ-invariant outputs.
• Within a fixed locked instantiation (Section V.A), varying an explicitly locked-for-reproducibility control parameter (e.g., σ_Π or η*) constitutes moving to a different locked variant; reported discriminator outputs must then be re-quoted for that variant.

(6) Reporting requirement (prevents scope drift).
Any section that uses GR/QFT language (metric curvature, horizons, Hawking scaling, ringdown templates) must state which of (1)–(4) are satisfied in that context and over what region/scale window.

WHAT PCT IS NOT CLAIMING (CANONICAL LIST)

To avoid ambiguity, the following are explicitly not claimed in this manuscript:

1. No full Standard Model derivation. The gauge group U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3), particle content, coupling running, flavor structure, and mass hierarchies are not derived here.

2. No unique projection rule Π (or Λ). Π and ν_Θ (Λ) are specified up to admissibility constraints; different admissible families generally define different PCT variants.

3. No guaranteed dynamical completion of Einstein gravity. The present paper establishes kinematic correspondence targets (cone structure, weak-field redshift via a proxy metric) but does not derive the Einstein field equations or a unique GR-limit dynamics from first principles.

4. No uniqueness theorem for emergent geometry. Even when a manifold-like regime exists, the reconstruction is only defined up to θ-gauge/diffeomorphism and may admit multiple observationally equivalent realisations.

5. No claim that toy numerics are directly physical. Numerical sections (V.B and related) demonstrate computability and isolate qualitative signatures; they are not direct empirical fits.

6. No claim that “environment dependence” replaces standard astrophysical systematics. Any comparison to black-hole observations must separate PCT effects from greybody factors, accretion physics, and radiative transfer.

7. No completion of the measurement problem. Record-stability criteria are offered as a selection principle, not a full interpretational or dynamical solution.

ASSUMPTIONS INVENTORY (CORE; TESTABLE/RELAXABLE; CONSEQUENCE OF VIOLATION)

Purpose. This table is a single, reader-facing inventory of the core assumptions the manuscript relies on, whether each is testable (in principle) and/or relaxable (i.e., can be weakened without breaking the framework), and exactly what becomes invalid if the assumption fails.

Legend.
• Testable? = can be directly confronted (empirically and/or by explicit in-model checks/diagnostics).
• Relaxable? = can be weakened to an alternative admissible variant without collapsing the whole framework (but theorems/predictions may downgrade).

| ID | Core assumption | Testable? | Relaxable? | If violated, what becomes invalid (minimum) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A0 | Scope gate discipline: any GR/QFT-language claim is only asserted after reporting (BC pass/fail, Ω, [ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) | Yes (audit/readability) | No (it is the interpretation rule) | Any GR/QFT-language inference made without explicit gates is out-of-scope by definition; internal consistency claims become non-auditable |
| A1 | Primitive well-posedness: (𝒦,Σ_𝒦,μ_𝒦) measurable; Π(·|u;θ) is a Markov kernel; ν_Θ is a probability measure | Partly (mathematical audit) | Partly (outer-measure / restricted domains) | G₂ pushforward definition fails → the entire reconstruction pipeline (G₂ → d_corr → L_ρ → d_s(ℓ)) is undefined |
| A2 | Kernel admissibility (M1): K symmetric PSD with sufficient regularity/decay for the stated RKHS/continuum claims | Yes (PSD + regularity checks; numerics) | Partly (weaker regularity, discrete-only variants) | Theorem 5’s metric reconstruction claims downgrade; positivity-based steps can fail; microclass membership fails → microclass-level claims do not apply |
| A3 | Projection consistency (M2) + mediator normalization (M3) | Yes (normalization checks) | Partly (approximate normalization with quantified error) | Born-volume construction and θ-invariant reporting lose operational meaning; many probability/measure claims become invalid |
| A4 | Correlation-distance compatibility (M4): Ĝ₂ induces a usable distance/pseudodistance on the stated window | Yes (BC1 diagnostics: quadratic residual + path additivity) | Yes (pseudometric + patch restriction) | Any claim of stable local geometry/metric g^{(E)}_{μν} is invalid; geometry branch results are out-of-scope (treat 𝓜 as label space in that region) |
| A5 | Spectral convergence (M5): d_s(ℓ) admits stable IR windows under refinement/scheme controls | Yes (refinement + estimator swaps; V.J) | Partly (treat d_s as scale-dependent diagnostic only) | Any IR-dimension claims and any κ/Δd_s claims that require a stable window lose meaning; discriminator robustness claims fail |
| A6 | C²/smoothness near diagonal (or sufficient regularity) for Theorem 5 metric extraction | Partly (numerical smoothness proxies) | Yes (weak derivatives / coarse-grained metric estimators) | Theorem 5 (local metric tensor from correlator decay) is invalid as stated; keep only distance-like structure and coarse-grained reconstructions |
| A7 | Admissibility / microcausality gate (BC2): Z_t>0 and Z_s>0 on Ω for causal interpretation | Yes (m_t,m_s margins) | No (violating it exits PCT-as-defined-here) | Causal-cone / microcausality results (IV.B) and any horizon/ringdown interpretation relying on v_char are excluded by construction |
| A8 | No-signaling factorization admissibility (Λ-4; V.U) | Yes (operational no-signaling checks in principle) | Partly (approximate factorization with bounds) | Any claim of operational compatibility with relativity (no controllable superluminal signaling) fails; PCT-as-an-operational theory is excluded |
| A9 | Record stability / outcome selection criteria (V.T) | Partly (toy operationalizations; robustness diagnostics) | Yes (replace by alternate selection principle) | Any interpretive claim linking projection-fiber weights to observed outcome frequencies becomes ambiguous; “measurement/outcomes” layer is underdetermined |
| A10 | Correspondence calibrations are treated as CAL (not evidence): e.g., weak-field mapping f(ρ̄) ↔ r_s/r (V.D) | Yes (compare to weak-field constraints) | Yes (alternate calibration targets or closure) | Weak-field GR correspondence statements (PPN γ≈1, redshift scaling) fail for this instantiation; discriminator modules may still be definable but their mapping to physical units changes |
| A11 | Locked instantiation choices are fixed when quoting numbers: Π-family/σ_Π, kernel family/η*, Z_t,Z_s ansatz, estimators (V.A; V.J.2b) | Yes (reproduce numbers under same scheme) | Yes (defines a different PCT variant) | Any specific numeric predictions quoted for the canonical instantiation (e.g., κ, Δd_s, dn_s/d ln k) are no longer applicable without re-locking and re-quoting |

SCOPE/ASSUMPTIONS TABLE (WHAT IS ASSUMED, WHERE, AND WHAT FAILS)

The table below is intended to be operational: it identifies exactly where each assumption enters, why it is needed, how it could be weakened, and what concretely breaks if it is violated.

| Assumption | Where used | Why needed | How to relax | What breaks if violated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| (Math) Measurability of (𝒦,Σ_𝒦,μ_𝒦) and Π(·|u;θ); ν_Θ is a probability measure | III.D.1–III.D.3; definition of G₂ | Ensures integrals/pushforwards defining G₂ are well-defined | Replace by outer-measure / Carathéodory construction; restrict to simple-function approximations | G₂ undefined → no reconstruction pipeline |
| (Math) Integrability of ρ_𝒦 (and required moments) | III.D; III.E; everywhere G₂, ρ̄ appears | Ensures finite normalizations and prevents divergences in induced correlators | Work with truncations/renormalized densities; allow σ-finite but controlled growth | Divergent/ill-defined G₂ or ρ̄; normalization Z fails |
| (Math) Kernel regularity/decay (M1; plus continuity/decay in III.D.4) | III.D.4–III.D.7; Theorems 4–6; microclass 𝒨 | Supports RKHS construction, continuum limit, and local expansions | Use weaker Sobolev/Hölder assumptions; treat purely discrete 𝒦 without continuum claims | Loss of RKHS smoothness; failure of continuum theorems; unstable/non-manifold-like reconstructions |
| (Math) G₂ is C² near the diagonal (or sufficient smoothness of d_corr) | Theorem 5; metric reconstruction (III.D.6, IV.A.3) | Needed to define g_μν via second derivatives / quadratic expansion | Use generalized/weak derivatives; define metric via finite-difference estimators or coarse-grained distance | No well-defined local metric tensor; only a non-smooth distance-like structure |
| (Math) Microclass axiom M4 (correlation-distance compatibility) | III.E; IV.A | Ensures d_corr behaves as a valid distance usable for reconstruction | Treat d_corr as a pseudometric; restrict to patches where triangle-like behavior holds | If M4 fails → “no metric” in operational sense (no stable local geometry) |
| (Math) Microclass axiom M5 (spectral convergence / stable IR) | III.E; IV.A.5; V.G–V.J | Ensures d_s(ℓ) has a stable large-scale/IR limit and is meaningful as a dimension diagnostic | Replace by scale-dependent dimension only; define IR dimension statistically over windows | If M5 fails → no stable IR dimension/plateau; dimensional predictions become non-robust |
| (Phys) Microcausality / admissibility of L_ρ (hyperbolicity; Z_t>0, Z_s>0 in admissible regime) | IV.B; C2; horizon module (IV.D) | Needed to define causal cones and to exclude acausal propagation | Allow controlled microcausality violation as a phenomenological extension (not PCT-as-defined-here) | Signaling/acausal commutator support; loss of well-posed evolution; excluded |
| (Phys) No-signaling factorization constraint on Π for spacelike separation | V.U; operational interpretation of entanglement | Preserves Bell-violating correlations without controllable superluminal signaling | Replace by approximate factorization with quantified bounds; restrict to regimes where violations are below detection | If factorization fails → controllable signaling appears → excluded |
| (Phys) Record stability / robustness criteria for measurement selection | V.T; interpretive link to “measurement outcomes” | Prevents arbitrary/unstable projections from counting as outcomes; supports classical records | Treat as an emergent selection principle rather than an axiom; quantify robustness via redundancy thresholds | Without record stability, “outcomes” are not stable; Born-volume link becomes operationally ambiguous |

FAILURE MODES BY ASSUMPTION (SHORT)

- If M4 fails (correlation-distance compatibility): d_corr does not behave as a usable distance → no stable local metric reconstruction (no “spacetime geometry” on 𝓜 in the sense used here).
- If M5 fails (spectral convergence): d_s(ℓ) has no stable IR plateau → no well-defined emergent dimension; dimensional predictions (including κ, Δd_s modules) lose meaning.
- If microcausality/admissibility fails (loss of hyperbolicity): characteristic cones are ill-defined → evolution is not well-posed and acausal propagation/signaling can occur → excluded.
- If Π-factorization/no-signaling fails: controllable superluminal signaling appears in 𝓜 → excluded by construction.
- If regularity assumptions (e.g., C² needed for Theorem 5) fail: theorems should be downgraded to coarse-grained/weak-form statements; one retains only non-smooth distance structure unless additional reconstruction machinery is introduced.

PARAMETER TAXONOMY (CONTROL-VARIABLE CROSSWALK)

The definitive “what is free vs fixed vs derived” schema is given above in (5) INDEPENDENT VARIABLES / CONTROL VARIABLES. The short taxonomy below is retained only as a crosswalk between that schema and the terms “primitive / derived / locked / calibrated / predicted” used throughout Sections IV–V.

Primitive inputs (PCT primitives): 𝒦, K, Π, Λ (≡ ν_Θ), ρ_𝒦.
Derived objects (forced once primitives are specified): G₂, d_corr, g_μν, L_ρ, A^{μν}, v_char, ρ̄.
Locked-for-reproducibility control parameters (instantiation choices in V.A): σ_Π, selected kernel family/η*, and explicit Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄) forms.
Calibrated-to-correspondence mappings (fit to known physics, not derived): weak-field mapping f(ρ̄) ↔ r_s/r (equivalently Newton’s G), and any entropy-area normalization η.
Falsifiable prediction parameters (reported outputs of the locked instantiation, with quoted uncertainty where given): κ, Δd_s, ε_0, dn_s/d ln k.

PARAMETER LEDGER (FREE PARAMETERS, PRIORS/RANGES, AND PREDICTED DIMENSIONLESS COMBINATIONS)

Purpose. This ledger lists every free parameter in v53, classifies it as (S) structural (defines an admissible PCT variant / scheme choice) versus (CAL) calibration (fixed by correspondence to known physics), and gives a concrete default prior/range for inference or sensitivity sweeps. “Free parameter” here means: a quantity that is (i) not fully fixed by the primitives + microclass axioms alone, and (ii) not a pure θ-gauge artifact.

Important scope note. Some items below are “protocol hyperparameters” (numerical tolerances, estimator/window choices). They are not physical parameters, but they *are* degrees of freedom that can move reported numbers; therefore they are tracked explicitly.

A. Structural (S): defines a PCT variant (or a scheme within a variant)

| Symbol / name | Where it enters | Type | Default prior / range (dimensionless unless stated) | Notes / constraints |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kernel family choice (e.g., RBF vs exponential vs compact support) | K(u,v) (M1; V.A.2; V.J.2b) | S | Discrete model class; compare ≥2 admissible families | Must satisfy PSD + regularity/decay (M1) and pass convergence/robustness (M5).
| Kernel scale/shape parameter(s) (e.g., η in K_η) | V.A.4; V.A.6a; V.J.1 | S | log-uniform on η over a decade window around η* (e.g., η ∈ [0.1η*, 10η*]) | In the canonical instantiation η* is determined by the selection rule; in alternative variants treat η as free but report sensitivity.
| Projection family choice (functional form of Π) | Π(·|u;θ) (M2) | S | Discrete model class; compare ≥2 admissible forms | Must be a Markov kernel; must satisfy no-signaling admissibility where invoked (Λ-4 / V.U).
| Projection width σ_Π | V.A.1–V.A.2; enters ℓ* via σ_Π/η* | S | log-uniform on σ_Π within (0,1) grid units; default σ_Π ∈ [0.05, 1.0] | Physical content appears only through dimensionless combinations after unit-fixing; in the κ module σ_Π and η* are degenerate via σ_Π/η*.
| Projection mediator ν_Θ hyperparameters (if ν_Θ is parameterized) | ν_Θ (Λ-1…Λ-5) | S | Dirichlet/GP-style weakly informative prior; enforce ν_Θ(Θ)=1 | Only θ-invariant observables are physical; ν_Θ freedom is restricted by robustness (Λ-3) and no-signaling (Λ-4).
| Deformation family choice Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄) (beyond the locked form) | IV.B–IV.D; V.A.3 | S | Discrete model class; constrained by BC2 and asymptotics | Must keep Z_t>0, Z_s>0 on admissible Ω (BC2); if the proxy convention g_tt g_rr = −1 is used, then Z_t Z_s = 1 is a consistency constraint.
| Critical threshold ρ̄_crit/ρ̄_0 | V.A.0; IV.D.2 | S | broad log-uniform on ρ̄_crit/ρ̄_0 ∈ [1.1, 10^3] | Must satisfy ρ̄_crit>ρ̄_0. Choice affects where the horizon module triggers; treat as structural unless fixed by a separate principle.
| Horizon outward threshold ε_out | IV.D.1; Definition III.F.4 | S (protocol/operational) | log-uniform in ε_out ∈ [10^{-4}, 10^{-1}] | Must be small; reported outputs must show stability under reasonable ε_out sweeps.
| Manifold-likeness tolerances (ε_quad, ε_path) | BC1; IV.A.6 | S (protocol/operational) | default ε_quad, ε_path ∈ [0.03, 0.10] | Tightening these shrinks the domain where geometry language is permitted; do not tune them to “make claims true.”
| IR-smoothness tolerances (ε_IR, ε_∇,IR, ρ̄_floor, L_IR) | BC5; IV.C | S (protocol/operational) | ε_IR≈0.05; ε_∇,IR≈0.1; ρ̄_floor>0 small; L_IR chosen per dataset | These govern when IR/QFT language is allowed; they are reporting conventions, not physical couplings.
| Discretization/refinement controls (N_𝒦, N_𝓜, a_N) | V.B; V.J | S (protocol) | N_𝒦, N_𝓜 large; treat as refinement parameters | Must demonstrate κ stability and Δd_s convergence under refinement (V.J; V.Z).
| d_s(ℓ) estimator controls (trace estimator; smoothing; ℓ-grid; step extraction rule) | IV.A.5a; V.G.5; V.Z F5–F6 | S (protocol) | declare explicitly; run estimator swaps | Not physical parameters, but they can create/erase steps; therefore null controls/estimator swaps are mandatory.
| Ringdown template nuisance/analysis parameters (windowing, PSD method, start-time prior width) | Appendix C; V.G.15 | S (protocol) | declare explicitly; run nuisance sweeps | Treated as analysis choices; must be stability-checked before interpreting ln B.

B. Calibration (CAL): fixed by correspondence to known physics (not counted as evidence)

| Symbol / name | Where it enters | Type | Default prior / range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Weak-field mapping constant(s) (sets Newton’s G) | V.D; V.O | CAL | fixed to match weak-field redshift/PPN; treat as delta prior after calibration | Encoded via f(ρ̄) ↔ Φ/c² or f(ρ̄) ↔ r_s/r; necessary consistency target, not a discriminator.
| Entropy-area normalization η (in S = ηA/(4ℓ_P²)) | V.V; Appendix A | CAL | η = 1 ± O(0.1) (convention-level) | Treated as correspondence normalization unless derived.
| Absolute unit conversion (toy → physical) | V.A.0; Appendix A | CAL | fixed by chosen mapping | Required to compare to physical seconds/meters; does not affect dimensionless discriminator ratios.
| c normalization (emergent speed) | IV.B.14 | CAL (convention) | fixed so v_char→c in the asymptotically flat regime | A unit choice once the correspondence limit is selected.

C. Predicted/bounded dimensionless combinations (not fit)

The following are *not* treated as free fit knobs in this manuscript; they are either (i) explicit predictions of the locked instantiation, or (ii) bounded by internal consistency/admissibility.

| Combination | Status | Meaning | Value/bound (v53) | What would falsify it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H | (PRED) discriminator | Dimensionless location of the d_s step relative to horizon scale | κ ∈ [0.75,0.85] (canonical band) | κ outside band after robustness controls (V.Z F6; and ringdown F2/F3).
| Δd_s | (PRED) discriminator | Step magnitude in spectral dimension | Δd_s>0 with continuum target ≈1.264 (V.J.2; V.H.3) | Δd_s→0 under refinement/estimator swaps (V.Z F5).
| v_char/c = √(Z_s/Z_t) | (BOUND) consistency | Characteristic-speed ratio | 0 < v_char/c ≤ 1 on admissible Ω | Violation of BC2 (Z_t≤0 or Z_s≤0) excludes the model instance by construction.
| Z_t Z_s = 1 (when the proxy convention g_tt g_rr = −1 is adopted) | (BOUND) consistency | Proxy-metric consistency constraint | Enforced in the locked deformation module; must hold wherever Theorem 6 is invoked | If a subsection uses that proxy convention but violates Z_t Z_s = 1, it is internally inconsistent (scope violation).

Operational reminder. If a value in any table/figure depends on an (S) structural parameter or a protocol choice above, the caption/table cell should list that dependency explicitly; only the dimensionless discriminator rows are intended as “risk-bearing” predictions.

PARAMETER TAXONOMY TABLE (OPERATIONAL)

| Category | Meaning (status) | Examples in this manuscript | How to treat in interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Derived (non-tunable outputs) | Forced once primitives + microclass/admissibility conditions are specified (not fit parameters). | G₂, d_corr, g_μν (reconstructed), L_ρ (inverse kernel/operator), A^{μν} (principal symbol), v_char, ρ̄, d_s(ℓ) (as a computed curve). | If these disagree with data in their domain of validity, revise primitives/axioms (or the claim), not “refit” them. |
| Locked-for-reproducibility | Concrete instantiation choices fixed to make the framework computable and reproducible; other choices define different PCT variants. | Π-family choice and σ_Π; kernel family choice and η* selection rule; explicit deformation ansatz Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄); toy discretizations (N_𝒦, N_M) where explicitly stated as protocol choices. | If data conflict, either (i) the locked variant is ruled out, or (ii) one must move to a different admissible variant and re-lock (keeping microclass axioms explicit). |
| Calibrated-to-match-GR (correspondence calibrations) | Parameters/mappings set by matching known IR physics; success here is necessary but not confirmatory. | f(ρ̄) ↔ r_s/r (fixes effective Newton coupling); normalization conventions such as η in S = ηA/(4ℓ_P²); the Minkowski-limit normalization setting c in the propagation sector. | Treat as required consistency matches; do not count them as “predictions.” |
| Purely illustrative / toy-only | Scaffolding for pedagogy or feasibility demonstrations; not asserted to represent nature without further justification. | Discrete toy grids, bump-profile choices for ρ_𝒦 in V.B, and any explicitly labeled “toy units” or example numeric values used only to demonstrate the protocol. | Do not compare these numerics directly to experiment; only compare dimensionless invariants and discriminator structures that survive refinement/robustness tests. |

PREDICTION vs CALIBRATION LABELING CONVENTION (FOR ALL NUMERIC VALUES)

To prevent “success-by-construction” ambiguity, every reported numeric value in this manuscript should be tagged as one of:

• (PRED) Predicted: obtained from the stated primitives + microclass axioms + locked instantiation choices, without being fit to the empirical dataset being discussed.
  Example: κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H = 0.80 ± 0.05 (PRED) in the locked discriminator module.

• (CAL) Calibrated / compatibility constrained: fixed by matching known physics or external constraints as an admissibility requirement; necessary but not confirmatory.
  Example: weak-field mapping f(ρ̄) ↔ r_s/r (CAL) and any implied PPN correspondence targets.

• (POST) Postdicted: inferred from (or chosen to match) the same dataset/realization being used to illustrate the claim (including in-silico toy runs used as “numbers on the page”), or computed after-the-fact from that specific realization without being presented as a forward prediction for independent data.
  Example: a single toy-run table of d_s(ℓ) values computed from one specific finite discretization is reported as (POST) unless explicitly used as a forward prediction for an independent dataset.

Reporting rule (tables/figures). In compact tables, place the tag immediately after each number, e.g., “0.80 ± 0.05 (PRED)” or “γ = 1 (CAL).”

MODEL AS A CAUSAL GRAPH (IVs → MEDIATORS → OBSERVABLES)

Cross-reference. This causal map is the structural complement to the “Explains vs merely reproduces” table in the Introduction (it shows how explanatory claims are realized as IV → mediator → DV linkages), and it fixes which links are tested by the discriminator-focused confirmation protocol (Section V; Master checklist V.Z).

ONE-PAGE MODEL MAP (IV → mediator → DV; WITH SCOPE GATES)

SINGLE-PAGE PIPELINE MAP (constructs → gates → outputs; with scale windows)

Legend.
• “→” denotes a dependency/derivation link.
• Each link is asserted only on the stated region Ω ⊂ 𝓜 and scale window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁] (and only when the listed gates pass).
• Gates (BC1–BC5) are evaluated as predicates on (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) and return PASS/FAIL.

  • Causal outputs: v_char, cone proxy g^{(L)}_{μν} (only when BC2 PASS on Ω).
  • Horizon outputs: Θ_out, V_{Π,out}, ∂B, r_H (only when BC2 PASS on the exterior and horizon diagnostics hold).
  • Discriminators: (κ, Δd_s) and downstream ringdown change-point timing t_c ∝ κ r_+/c (only in near-horizon window; V.G–V.Z).

Scale-window reporting rule (one line).
Any claim that uses GR/QFT language must state (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) explicitly and list which gates passed; otherwise the claim is out of scope by definition.

The table below is the “at-a-glance” mapping from independent variables to the paper’s main reported observables. It is intentionally redundant with the longer derivation maps; the purpose is to make IV→DV linkages and assumption-classes explicit in one place.

| Output / DV (what is reported) | Primary controlling inputs (IVs / locked choices) | Required scope gates / assumptions (what must pass first) | Where defined / tested |
|---|---|---|---|
| g_μν (metric proxy / reconstructed geometry) | (K, ρ_𝒦, Π, ν_Θ) via G₂ and d_corr | BC1 manifold-likeness; regularity assumptions (G₂ C² near diagonal) | III.D.6; IV.A; BC1 |
| v_char/c (propagation sector) | Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄) (and thus Π, ρ_𝒦 through ρ̄) | BC2 hyperbolicity/admissibility (Z_t>0, Z_s>0) | IV.B–IV.C; BC2 |
| Horizon indicators (Θ_out, V_Π,out) | (Π, ν_Θ) and Z_t/Z_s through v_char thresholding | BC2 (admissibility) and near-horizon diagnostics (suppression conditions) | IV.D; BC2; “Near-horizon” conditions |
| d_s(ℓ) curve (dimensional diagnostics) | L_ρ (hence K, Π, ρ_𝒦) + estimator choices | BC1/BC2 as applicable for interpretation; spectral convergence (M5) for IR plateau claims | IV.A.5; V.G–V.J |
| Discontinuity observables (κ, Δd_s) [primary discriminator] | Locked instantiation inputs (V.A): Π-family/σ_Π, kernel family/η*, deformation module; r_H definition | Near-horizon scope gate; estimator resolution controls; refinement/convergence tests | V.G–V.J; V.Z F5–F6 |
| Ringdown change-point (t_c, ε_0; template) [derived discriminator] | κ module + mapping to r_+(M,a*) and waveform template family | Applicability of ringdown model; robustness/null tests (V.Z F1–F4) | V.G.15; V.Z F1–F4 |
| Cosmology running dn_s/d ln k (and r pattern) [model-locked discriminator] | Locked cosmology mapping (V.I–V.M) and α_PCT | Cosmology-module assumptions; robustness under parameter/foreground models (V.Z F7–F8) | V.M; V.Z F7–F8 |
| Cross-observable consistency (redshift vs propagation) [consistency discriminator] | Shared deformation channel ρ̄→(Z_t,Z_s); calibration mapping for weak-field regime | Joint-fit consistency test; environment mapping uncertainty treated explicitly | V.W; V.Z F10 |

Interpretation rule (one sentence). Only the “primary discriminator” rows are intended as confirmatory dependent variables; correspondence targets and secondary diagnostics are necessary for internal consistency and scope gating but are not treated as evidence by themselves.

The logical structure of the framework can be read as a causal (structural-equation) graph:

Independent variables (IVs / exogenous inputs):
• K(u,v): pregeometric correlation kernel on 𝒦.
• ρ_𝒦(u): constraint population on 𝒦.
• Π-family parameters: choice of projection family Π(·|u;θ) (including any width/shape parameters such as σ_Π and any parametrization of f_θ).
• Λ constraints: ν_Θ (Λ) and its admissibility constraints (measurability/normalization/robustness, no-signaling factorization constraints when applicable).
• Microclass axioms: M1–M5 (membership in 𝒨), which act as global structural constraints on which (K, Π, Λ) are allowed.

Mediators (endogenous but typically unobserved):
• G₂(x,y;θ) induced from (K, ρ_𝒦, Π, ν_Θ).
• L_ρ (the effective generator) obtained (formally) as the inverse kernel of G₂.
• ρ̄(x;θ) (projected environment field) induced from (ρ_𝒦, Π).
• Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄) (principal-symbol deformation functions) mapping ρ̄ to A^{μν} and thus to causal cones/clock rates.

Mediator vs moderator note (explicit; where each enters the pipeline).

**Mediators (mechanistic variables; transmit influence from primitives → outputs).**
These are the variables that *carry* the dependence of reported observables on the exogenous inputs (K, ρ_𝒦, Π, ν_Θ). In causal-graph terms, they sit on the directed paths from the primitives to reported outputs.

• **G₂(x,y;θ) — Mediator (geometry seed + correlation structure).**
Operationalization / measurement: in a model-side instantiation, compute by the pushforward sum/integral in (eqIV.A.1) from the specified primitives. In a data-side instantiation, treat G₂ (or its normalized analogue Ĝ₂) as an empirically estimated two-point correlator (e.g., a measured covariance / Green’s function / two-point statistic on an observed network or lattice), with an explicit estimator and uncertainty model.

• **d_corr(x,y;θ) (or d_α) — Mediator (geometry proxy).**
Operationalization / measurement: once Ĝ₂ is available, compute d_corr := −log Ĝ₂ (or the decay-class-adjusted d_α). In applied settings, this is operationally a *derived* distance-like statistic computed from measured two-point correlations; it is “measured” only via the measured correlator and the declared transformation (log + normalization + any α choice).

• **ρ̄(x;θ) — Mediator (environment / order-parameter field).**
Operationalization / measurement: compute from primitives by (eqIV.C.1)–(eqIV.C.2). In empirical/operator-surrogate contexts, treat ρ̄ as an inferred latent scalar field on 𝓜 obtained by fitting the deformation channel to clock-rate and/or propagation data (e.g., infer Z_t(·), Z_s(·) from redshift/propagation observables, then invert the locked Z(ρ̄) family to recover an effective ρ̄ profile on Ω).

• **L_ρ — Mediator (effective generator / inverse-kernel operator).**
Operationalization / measurement: compute as the inverse-kernel operator satisfying L_ρ∘G₂=δ (eqIV.A.5), or (data-side) adopt a Laplacian/operator surrogate L extracted from the system and treat it as the operational stand-in for L_ρ. In either case, L_ρ is “measured” via operator estimation (matrix inference on a graph, discretized differential operator fit, etc.) and validated by checking that it reproduces the observed heat-trace/return-probability object P(ℓ) over the stated window.

• **A^{μν}(x) and (Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄)) — Mediators (propagation-sector deformation / cone data).**
Operationalization / measurement: infer from local dispersion/propagation observables on 𝓜 (time-of-flight, characteristic-speed proxies, causal response/retarded support diagnostics) by fitting the principal-symbol form A^{μν}k_μk_ν with A^{00}=Z_t and A^{ij}=−Z_s δ^{ij} in the isotropic parametrization. Practically, Z_s/Z_t is identified via v_char/c = √(Z_s/Z_t), while Z_t itself is constrained by clock-rate observables (dτ/dt = 1/√Z_t) when those are available in the same environment class.


**Moderators (gating/threshold variables; condition applicability of links).**
These are variables that do *not* carry causal influence from primitives to outputs, but instead *switch on/off or condition* whether a mediator→output interpretation/claim is licensed on a stated (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]).

• **BC1 (manifold-likeness gate) — Moderator.**
Operationalization / measurement: evaluate via the quadratic residual and path-additivity diagnostics (BC1 / IV.A.6) computed from d_corr (or d_α) on Ω over the displacement/scale window; report pass/fail with the explicit tolerances (ε_quad, ε_path) and the sampling stencil used.

• **BC2 (hyperbolicity/admissibility gate) — Moderator.**
Operationalization / measurement: evaluate by checking positivity margins m_t := inf_Ω Z_t and m_s := inf_Ω Z_s (BC2 / IV.B.19). Empirically, this corresponds to verifying well-posed propagation (no loss of hyperbolicity) in the effective operator fit over the analyzed region.

• **BC3–BC5 (kernel/projection admissibility; IR windowing) — Moderators.**
Operationalization / measurement: apply as explicit model-class membership tests (PSD/regularity for K; Markov normalization for Π; ν_Θ normalization; “slowly varying ρ̄” diagnostic ε_∇ and weak deformation ε_Z), all evaluated on the declared domain/window.

• **Threshold/decision variables (ε_out, ε_quad, ε_path, estimator windowing, step-extraction rule) — Moderators.**
Operationalization / measurement: these are protocol hyperparameters rather than physical fields; they are “measured” only in the sense that their chosen numerical values are declared and sensitivity-tested. In particular, ε_out defines Θ_out and V_{Π,out} (IV.D.1), and the (ℓ*,Δd_s) extraction rule defines what counts as a “step” versus smooth flow (IV.A.5a; V.G.5; V.Z).

Dependent variables / observables (DVs):
• g_μν (or metric proxy) reconstructed from correlator decay / principal symbol data.
• d_s(ℓ) (spectral dimension) from the heat trace of L_ρ.
• κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H and Δd_s (dimensional-discontinuity observables).
• Ringdown change-point parameters (t_c and related template parameters).
• Cosmological observables tied to early-universe dimensional flow (e.g., dn_s/d ln k).

Status of “IVs” (what is free vs invariant vs calibrated):
• Free-to-choose within the admissible microclass 𝒨: the detailed functional family for Π and ν_Θ (Λ), subject to Λ-1…Λ-5 and M1–M5; different admissible choices define different PCT variants.
• Fixed/locked for reproducibility in the numerical instantiation (Section V.A): specific Π-family choice and its parameters (e.g., σ_Π), kernel-family choice/selection rule (e.g., RBF K_η with η*), and explicit deformation forms Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄).
• Calibrated (not derived) to match known IR physics: the weak-field mapping f(ρ̄) ↔ r_s/r (equivalently Newton’s G) and any entropy-area normalization convention.
• Invariant/forced within the microclass (structural outputs): once (K, ρ_𝒦, Π, ν_Θ) are fixed, the mediators (G₂, L_ρ, ρ̄) and θ-invariant observables (e.g., d_s(ℓ) profile, and any derived κ, Δd_s in the locked instantiation) are not additional choices—they are determined by the construction.

STATUS OF EVIDENCE (OBSERVATIONAL/EXPERIMENTAL HANDLE TABLE)

Correspondence & constraint ledger (channels used as constraints, not confirmations).
This ledger is the “public constraint comparison” layer: it records which PCT quantities are matched/compared to established constraints, whether that match is by construction (calibration/compatibility) or inferred from data, and what would falsify the relevant PCT module when treated as a discriminator (see V.Z for thresholds).

| Channel | (i) PCT quantity matched | (ii) Public constraint being compared against | (iii) Comparison type | (iv) What would falsify us here (one sentence) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Weak-field / PPN | PPN parameter γ (and weak-field redshift scaling via g_tt,g_rr) (V.D) | Solar-system time-delay/deflection bounds on γ (e.g., Cassini Shapiro delay; [41]) | By construction (correspondence calibration/compatibility constraint) | If precision weak-field tests require γ≠1 beyond accepted uncertainty while this locked Z_t,Z_s mapping predicts γ=1, then this correspondence calibration fails (V.Z F9). |
| GW strong-field tests-of-GR context | Ringdown deviation scale used for context: fractional QNM frequency deviation bounds (e.g., δf_{220}/f_{220}) and “tests of GR” residual constraints (V.G.12) | LVK Tests of GR (GWTC-3) bounds on fractional deviations in ringdown mode frequencies (analysis-window dependent; [43]) | Inferred from data (published constraints; used here as a non-contradiction check, not a calibration) | If late-time-inclusive change-point analyses prefer GR-only at strong odds and/or infer κ outside the allowed band or non-universal across events, the κ→ringdown imprint discriminator module is falsified (V.Z F1–F4). |
| CMB running | Running dn_s/d ln k (V.M.4) | Planck 2018 constraint on dn_s/d ln k (and compatible independent constraints where available; [39]) | Inferred from data (parameter inference; used here as a current-consistency check) | If next-generation CMB posteriors rule out negative running at the ~10⁻2 level (wrong sign or |dn_s/d ln k| too small at ≥3σ), the locked cosmology module is falsified (V.Z F7). |

The table below is a practical “evidence ledger.” It does not assert confirmation; it states what kind of data exist, what PCT predicts, and what would be required to discriminate PCT from standard GR/QFT baselines.

| Channel | Data type | Current constraint (baseline statement) | What PCT predicts | What’s needed to discriminate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Solar-system PPN / weak-field GR | Time-delay, tracking, ephemerides (e.g., Cassini Shapiro delay) | γ is constrained very close to 1 in the weak field; GR passes existing bounds | In the IR/weak-field regime PCT is constructed to reproduce γ ≈ 1 and Schwarzschild redshift at leading order (correspondence target) | Not a discriminator unless a specific PCT variant predicts γ ≠ 1 or correlated deviations between redshift and propagation delay (budget-coupling tests) |
| GW ringdown (late-time) | GW strain residuals in post-merger ringdown; stacked analyses | Current public ringdown tests typically constrain percent-level deviations in mode frequencies (analysis-window dependent) | A change-point signature at t_c(M,a*) ∝ κ r_+/c with κ ≈ 0.80 ± 0.05 and sub-percent (∼10⁻³) late-time deviations | High-SNR ringdowns + late-time windows and explicit change-point model comparison (Bayes factor vs GR-only), stacked across events |
| CMB running dn_s/d ln k | CMB temperature/polarization power spectra; parameter inference | Current constraints are consistent with small running; sign/magnitude not yet decisive at the ∼10⁻2 level | dn_s/d ln k = −0.012 ± 0.005 (model-locked prediction) | Next-generation CMB constraints reaching a few ×10⁻3 on running, with control of foreground/systematic priors |
| Analogue systems (BEC / optical lattice) | Laboratory measurement of diffusion/return probability / effective spectral dimension d_s(ℓ) | No consensus “spectral-dimension discontinuity” measurement exists as a standard result | A discontinuous step in d_s(ℓ) near ℓ* (with a model-predicted scale ratio κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H in the analogue mapping) | Controlled analogue-horizon set-ups with resolution δℓ/ℓ* ≲ 0.1 and repeated measurements to establish a statistically significant step vs smooth flow |
| Near-horizon dimensional diagnostics (in silico) | Numerical realizations of (𝒦, K, Π, Λ) with heat-trace computation | Baseline GR+local EFT treatments produce continuous d_s(ℓ) flow | A discontinuity in d_s(ℓ) at ℓ* and associated pair (κ, Δd_s) in the locked microclass | Robust convergence tests under refinement (N_𝒦→∞, alternative discretizations) showing nonzero limiting Δd_s and stable κ |

MINIMAL FORMAL CORE (PRIMITIVES, TYPES, INVARIANTS)

STANDARDIZED DEFINITION / PROPOSITION BLOCKS (CONVENTION USED BELOW)

To make later dependencies auditable, any definition/proposition used downstream should appear in a compact block with:
• Label: “Definition X.Y” or “Proposition X.Y” (or “Theorem” where appropriate).
• Type signature (domain/codomain) for every map introduced.
• Assumptions (if any) stated explicitly.
• Proof or proof sketch for any nontrivial claim used downstream.

This box states the minimal formal objects assumed by PCT, without interpretation.

PRIMITIVES (objects and types)

(1) Constraint space: 𝒦 is a measurable space, typically taken as a metric measure space (𝒦, Σ_𝒦, μ_𝒦, d_𝒦).

(2) Constraint population: ρ_𝒦: 𝒦 → ℝ_+ is μ_𝒦-measurable and integrable (a weighting/density on 𝒦, not a spacetime field).

(3) Compatibility / correlation kernel: K: 𝒦 × 𝒦 → ℝ_+ is symmetric and positive semidefinite (PSD), and (in continuum settings) sufficiently regular/decaying to support the RKHS construction.

(4) Emergent label space: 𝓜 is a measurable space (often equipped with additional structure only after reconstruction).

(5) Projection-parameter (“angle”) space: Θ is a measurable space.

(6) Projection mediator: ν_Θ is a probability measure on Θ (Λ ≡ ν_Θ in the rigorous formulation).

(7) Projection kernel: Π is a Markov kernel
  Π : 𝒦 × Θ → 𝒫(𝓜),
meaning: for each (u,θ) it returns a probability measure Π(·|u;θ) on 𝓜.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DERIVED (standard constructions used throughout)

(8) Induced two-point correlator on 𝓜.
Type signature:
  G₂ : 𝓜 × 𝓜 × Θ → ℝ  (or ℂ if phases are allowed by the chosen K/Π),
with, for each fixed θ,
  G₂(·,·;θ) : 𝓜 × 𝓜 → ℝ.
Definition:
  G₂(x,y;θ) := (1/Z) ∫_𝒦∫_𝒦 K(u,v) ρ_𝒦(u) ρ_𝒦(v) Π(x|u;θ) Π(y|v;θ)
  (with an appropriate normalization Z).

(9) Correlation distance and metric reconstruction (when smoothness holds).

Definition:
  d_corr(x,y;θ) := −log( |G₂(x,y;θ)| / √(G₂(x,x;θ)G₂(y,y;θ)) ).
Local metric reconstruction claim (used only when the stated regularity gates pass):
  locally d_corr(x,x+dx;θ)^2 ≈ g_μν(x;θ) dx^μ dx^ν.

(10) Effective generator (formal inverse kernel).
Type signature:
  L_ρ(·,·;θ) : (functions/distributions on 𝓜) → (functions/distributions on 𝓜),

2–3 θ-INVARIANT OBSERVABLES / INVARIANTS (used as “outputs”)

(I1) Spectral dimension: d_s(ℓ) := −2 ∂ ln Tr(e^{−ℓ^2 L_ρ}) / ∂ ln(ℓ^2).
(I2) Causal-cone/characteristic-speed invariant (given principal symbol A^{μν}): v_char(x)/c = √(Z_s/Z_t) (as a scalar ratio in the isotropic parametrization).
(I3) Horizon scale invariant (used in predictions): r_H := √(A_horizon/4π) (geometric definition when a horizon area is reconstructible).

III.F Formal definitions and short lemmas (compatibility volumes, horizon proxies, gates, reconstruction map)
This subsection upgrades the core informal constructs into explicit definitions and records a minimal set of lemmas that are used repeatedly later. These are not new physical postulates; they are bookkeeping definitions and consequences of the already-stated primitives and admissibility gates.

Definition III.F.1 (Reconstruction map, regime-gated; formal).
Fix a region Ω ⊂ 𝓜 and a scale window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁].

Type signature (domain/codomain).
  \mathcal{R}_{\Omega,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]} : \big( (𝒦,Σ_𝒦,μ_𝒦),\ K,\ ρ_𝒦,\ (Θ,ν_Θ),\ Π \big)
  \longrightarrow \Big( d_\mathrm{corr}|_{\Omega},\ g^{(E)}_{\mu\nu}|_{\Omega},\ A^{\mu\nu}|_{\Omega},\ d_s(\ell)|_{[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]}\Big),
where the codomain entries are (respectively) a pseudodistance on Ω, a symmetric 2-tensor field on Ω (when defined), a principal-symbol tensor field on Ω, and a real-valued function of ℓ on [ℓ₀,ℓ₁].

Definition.
Define the reconstruction map
  \mathcal{R}_{\Omega,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]} : (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦, Π, ν_Θ) \longmapsto \big(d_\mathrm{corr}|_{\Omega},\ g^{(E)}_{\mu\nu}|_{\Omega},\ A^{\mu\nu}|_{\Omega},\ d_s(\ell)|_{[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]}\big),
where d_corr and g^{(E)}_{\mu\nu} are reconstructed from G₂ by (eqIV.A.1)–(eqIV.A.4), A^{\mu\nu} is the principal symbol tensor of the induced generator (IV.B), and d_s(\ell) is defined by the heat-trace prescription (eqIV.A.6)–(eqIV.A.7).

Definition III.F.2 (Gate as a predicate with pass/fail output).
A “gate” is a predicate evaluated on a specified (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) that returns PASS or FAIL together with the diagnostics used.
• BC1(Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) is the manifold-likeness gate defined by the quadratic residual and path-additivity diagnostics (BC1 / IV.A.6).
• BC2(Ω) is the causal admissibility gate defined by hyperbolicity margins m_t>0 and m_s>0 (BC2 / IV.B.19).
• BC3–BC5 are the kernel/projection/admissibility and “slowly varying ρ̄” gates as stated in the BC checklist.
Interpretation rule (consistency). Any statement phrased in GR/QFT language is permitted only when the required gates for that statement are explicitly reported as PASS on the stated (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]).

Definition III.F.3 (Compatibility volume; general).
Let (Θ,ν_Θ,Π) be the projection structure and let S(x) ⊆ Θ be a measurable subset (possibly x-dependent) encoding an admissibility criterion on projection parameters at x ∈ 𝓜.

Type signatures.
• Induced local weight:
  w(\cdot\,|\,\cdot) : Θ × 𝓜 → ℝ_{d7d9},  with \int_Θ w(\theta|x)\,d\theta = 1 for each x where it is invoked.
• Compatibility-volume functional:
  V_\Pi[\,\cdot\,] : (measurable subsets of Θ)^𝓜 → (functions 𝓜→[0,1]).

Definition.
Define the compatibility volume of S at x by
  V_\Pi[S](x) := \int_{S(x)} w(\theta\,|\,x)\, d\theta,
where w(\theta|x) is the induced local weight on Θ at x (used later in the horizon module IV.D.1).

Definition III.F.4 (Outward-compatible set and outward compatibility volume).
Fix an outward-admissibility threshold ε_out ∈ (0,1) and define v_min := ε_out c. Define
  \Theta_{\mathrm{out}}(x) := \{\theta\in\Theta : v_{\mathrm{char}}(x;\theta)\ge v_{\min}\},
and define the outward compatibility volume
  V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}(x) := V_\Pi[\Theta_{\mathrm{out}}](x).
This formalizes “outward-compatible projection volume” as a compatibility volume for the specific admissibility set Θ_out.

Definition III.F.5 (Horizon proxy and horizon boundary; operational).
Fix ε_out and define the horizon proxy
  H(x) := V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}(x).
A horizon boundary is then (as used throughout Section IV.D)
  \partial B := \{x\in\Omega : H(x) \to 0\ \text{(asymptotic suppression in the stated scheme)}\},
with the understanding that this definition is meaningful only on exterior regions where BC2 holds (so v_char is defined and admissible).

Lemma III.F.6 (Boundedness of compatibility volumes).
Assume w(\theta|x) is a normalized probability density on Θ for each x (so \int_\Theta w(\theta|x) d\theta = 1). Then for any measurable S(x) ⊆ Θ,
  0 \le V_\Pi[S](x) \le 1.
In particular, 0 \le V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}(x) \le 1.
Proof. Nonnegativity follows from w\ge 0; the upper bound follows from S(x)\subseteq\Theta and normalization.

Lemma III.F.7 (Monotonicity of outward compatibility volume under threshold tightening).
Let ε_out^{(1)} < ε_out^{(2)} with corresponding v_min^{(i)} = ε_out^{(i)}c and sets Θ_out^{(i)}(x). Then
  \Theta_{\mathrm{out}}^{(2)}(x) \subseteq \Theta_{\mathrm{out}}^{(1)}(x) \quad\Rightarrow\quad V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}^{(2)}(x) \le V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}^{(1)}(x).
Proof. Immediate from set inclusion and Definition III.F.3 with w\ge 0.

Lemma III.F.8 (Existence of a cone proxy under BC2).
Assume BC2 holds on Ω, i.e. Z_t(ρ̄(x;\theta))>0 and Z_s(ρ̄(x;\theta))>0 on Ω for the admissible sector (IV.B.19). In the isotropic parametrization (eqIV.B.10)–(eqIV.B.11), define the cone-proxy Lorentzian metric (mostly-plus convention)
  g^{(L)}_{\mu\nu}(x) := \mathrm{diag}(-1/Z_t(x),\ 1/Z_s(x),\ 1/Z_s(x),\ 1/Z_s(x)).
Then g^{(L)} has Lorentzian signature (−,+,+,+) on Ω and its null covectors coincide with the characteristic covectors of the principal symbol:
  A^{\mu\nu}(x)k_\mu k_\nu = 0 \iff g^{(L)\mu\nu}(x)k_\mu k_\nu = 0.
Proof. Under BC2, the diagonal entries have the stated signs, giving Lorentzian signature. Moreover, g^{(L)\mu\nu}=\mathrm{diag}(-Z_t,\ Z_s,\ Z_s,\ Z_s) is proportional (up to the sign convention) to A^{\mu\nu}=\mathrm{diag}(Z_t,\ -Z_s,\ -Z_s,\ -Z_s); multiplying by −1 does not change the null set.

CORRESPONDENCE CHECK (B.8): RECOVERY OF A STANDARD LOCAL WAVE-EQUATION LIMIT FROM THE PRINCIPAL SYMBOL.
Purpose. This short subsection makes explicit (i) what “IR/local-field correspondence” means in this manuscript, and (ii) the exact assumptions under which the induced operator surrogate $L_\rho$ reduces to an approximately local, second-order hyperbolic wave operator on a slowly varying background.

Setup (what is actually used).
• The principal symbol $A^{\mu\nu}(x)$ is defined as the leading (highest-derivative) part of $L_\rho$ in a local derivative expansion on a gated domain where such an expansion is meaningful.
• In the isotropic parametrization invoked throughout IV.B (and in Lemma III.F.8),
  $$A^{\mu\nu}(x)=\mathrm{diag}(Z_t(x),-Z_s(x),-Z_s(x),-Z_s(x)),$$
  with $Z_t(x)=Z_t(\bar\rho(x))$ and $Z_s(x)=Z_s(\bar\rho(x))$.

Assumptions (explicit; these are correspondence conditions, not guaranteed).
(CORR-1) BC2 holds on $\Omega$ (hyperbolicity/admissibility): $Z_t(x)>0$ and $Z_s(x)>0$ for all $x\in\Omega$.
(CORR-2) Locality/derivative expansion is valid on the stated scale window: there exists a length scale $L_{\mathrm{bg}}$ such that $Z_t,Z_s$ vary slowly compared to the probe wavelength $\lambda$ on $\Omega$, e.g.
  $$\max_{x\in\Omega}\left(\frac{|\nabla Z_t(x)|}{Z_t(x)},\frac{|\nabla Z_s(x)|}{Z_s(x)}\right)\ll \frac{1}{\lambda}.$$
(CORR-3) Nonlocal/higher-derivative parts of $L_\rho$ are subleading on that window (i.e., lower-order terms do not change the characteristic set to leading order).

Derivation (principal-symbol → dispersion → local wave equation).
On $\Omega$ and on scales where (CORR-2)–(CORR-3) hold, the effective equation for a scalar probe $\psi$ can be written schematically as
  $$L_\rho\psi \;\approx\; -\partial_\mu\bigl(A^{\mu\nu}(x)\,\partial_\nu\psi\bigr) + \text{(lower-order terms)}.$$
For a WKB ansatz $\psi\sim e^{i(\mathbf k\cdot\mathbf x-\omega t)}$ in a locally constant patch, the principal symbol yields the leading dispersion relation
  $$A^{\mu\nu}k_\mu k_\nu = 0\quad\Rightarrow\quad Z_t\,\omega^2 - Z_s\,|\mathbf k|^2 = 0\quad\Rightarrow\quad \omega^2 = \frac{Z_s}{Z_t}\,|\mathbf k|^2.$$
Thus the local characteristic (phase/group) speed is
  $$v_{\mathrm{char}}(x)=c\sqrt{\frac{Z_s(x)}{Z_t(x)}}$$
(in agreement with the definition already used in IV.B), and the local “wave-operator” limit is the standard curved-background hyperbolic operator associated with the cone proxy $g^{(L)}$ (Lemma III.F.8): up to lower-order terms,
  $$L_\rho\psi\;\approx\;\Box_{g^{(L)}}\psi\quad\text{on }(\Omega,[\ell_0,\ell_1])\text{ where (CORR-1)–(CORR-3) hold.}$$

Minkowski / slowly varying background limit (the explicit standard limit).
If there exists a subregion $\Omega_{\infty}\subset\Omega$ such that $Z_t(x)\to 1$ and $Z_s(x)\to 1$ (asymptotically flat correspondence normalization; cf. IV.B.14), then on $\Omega_{\infty}$ the dispersion becomes $\omega^2=|\mathbf k|^2$ and the local equation reduces to the standard wave equation
  $$\partial_t^2\psi - c^2\nabla^2\psi \;\approx\; 0.$$
A minimal numerical demonstration in any concrete instantiation is then: compute $Z_t(x),Z_s(x)$ from the same run, verify $Z_t,Z_s\approx 1$ on a declared exterior patch, and check that the predicted travel time for a ray crossing that patch,
  $$\Delta t_{\mathrm{pred}}\;=\;\int_{\gamma}\frac{ds}{v_{\mathrm{char}}(x)},$$
matches a direct finite-difference propagation using the local surrogate operator above to within the declared accuracy on the chosen discretization.

Failure cases (explicit; when correspondence should be declared out of scope).
• (FAIL-1) BC2 fails anywhere in the claimed domain: $Z_t\le 0$ or $Z_s\le 0$ implies loss of hyperbolicity; there is no well-posed local wave equation and no causal-cone interpretation.
• (FAIL-2) Background not slowly varying on the probe scale: if $|\nabla Z|/Z\not\ll 1/\lambda$, WKB/local-dispersion reasoning breaks down and mode conversion/reflection can dominate.
• (FAIL-3) Strong nonlocal/higher-derivative contributions of $L_\rho$ on the stated window: the principal symbol may still define characteristics, but local second-order PDE dynamics is not a good approximation.
• (FAIL-4) Anisotropic principal symbol (if present in a variant): the recovered limit is not the standard isotropic wave equation but an anisotropic (possibly birefringent) propagation law; this must be reported as such.

OPERATIONAL POSTULATES (INTERFACE: PREPARATIONS, TRANSFORMATIONS, MEASUREMENTS)

This list is an “operational/axiomatic interface” between the PCT primitives and laboratory statements. The purpose is to state, in the language of preparations/transformations/measurements, what is being assumed at the level of controllable procedures, without importing GR/QFT language until the regime gates pass.

Operational vocabulary.
• A preparation is any controlled procedure that produces a reproducible family of projected statistics on 𝓜, i.e., it fixes (up to declared gauge) an admissible population on 𝒦 and an admissible projection/mediator class.
• A transformation is any controlled intervention applied between preparation and readout that modifies the admissible family (typically by changing constraints on 𝒦 and/or by changing the allowed projection sector).
• A measurement is any controlled procedure that stabilizes a record on 𝓜 (V.T) and returns an outcome label m.

(OP0) Primitive interface objects.
The operational theory is built from the same primitives as the formal theory:
(𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦, Π, ν_Θ) with Π a Markov kernel and ν_Θ the mediator measure.

(OP1) Preparations = admissible pregeometric ensembles.
A lab preparation P is represented by a choice of an admissible constraint-population family ρ_𝒦^{(P)} on 𝒦 (possibly with a restricted support or constraints), together with an admissible projection/mediator class (Π^{(P)}, ν_Θ^{(P)}) satisfying the basic measurability/normalization conditions.
Operational statement: “Preparing a system” means fixing, reproducibly, which ensemble of pregeometric configurations is sampled and which projection family is admissible for that context.

(OP2) Transformations = admissible maps on the primitives.
A lab transformation T is any admissible map that takes one allowed interface tuple to another:


    (ρ_𝒦, Π, ν_Θ) \mapsto (ρ_𝒦', Π', ν_Θ')


subject to preserving microclass membership and operational admissibility (M1–M5 and Λ-1…Λ-5).
Operational statement: “Applying a gate / evolution / setting a knob” corresponds to changing constraints on 𝒦 (hence ρ_𝒦), and/or changing the admissible projection family/mediator (Π, ν_Θ) within the allowed class.

(OP3) Measurements = record-stabilizing coarse-grainings on 𝓜.
A measurement context M is represented by a family of coarse-graining maps (or partitions) on 𝓜 into outcome regions {R_m} and a record-stability criterion (V.T) that selects which projection sectors count as actual outcomes.

Outcome rule: the outcome label m is the (recorded) region R_m hit by the realized projection on 𝓜.

(OP4) Probabilities = projection-fiber weights (Born-volume rule).
For a preparation P and measurement context M, the probability of observing outcome m is:


    P(m|P,M) = W(m) / \sum_{m'} W(m')


with fiber weight W(m) = \int_{F(m)} ρ_𝒦 \, dV_𝒦, where F(m) := {u \in 𝒦 : Π(\cdot|u;θ) has support in R_m in the stabilized sector}.
Operational statement: outcome statistics come from weights of preimages under the stabilized projection, not from a separate postulate about wavefunctions.

(OP5) No-signaling = an admissibility constraint on (Π, ν_Θ), not an extra dynamical postulate.
Consider two disjoint controllable “sites” A and B in the emergent label space 𝓜, with locally choosable settings a and b (transformations) and local readouts m_A, m_B (measurements). The no-signaling requirement is stated purely as an operational marginal-invariance constraint:


    \sum_{m_B} P(m_A,m_B\,|\,a,b) = P(m_A\,|\,a) \quad \text{for all } b,
    \sum_{m_A} P(m_A,m_B\,|\,a,b) = P(m_B\,|\,b) \quad \text{for all } a.


In PCT, this is enforced by restricting the admissible model class:
• Π must factorize appropriately for disjoint-site interventions (Section V.U), and
• ν_Θ (Λ) must not correlate θ-selections in a way that turns correlation into controllable superluminal control (Λ-4).

Crucially: correlations in joint outcomes are allowed (K is nonlocal on 𝒦); controllable signaling is excluded by admissibility of Π and ν_Θ.

(OP6) Microcausality = an admissibility constraint on the induced generator, gated by BC diagnostics.
Microcausality is stated without importing GR/QFT language as follows.

Step 1 (regime gate). Only when the causal admissibility diagnostic BC2 passes on a region Ω (i.e., the induced propagation sector is well-posed in the sense of IV.B), we permit defining an operational causal-separation relation “A-spacelike” on 𝓜 from the characteristic structure of the induced generator. If BC2 fails, microcausality claims are out of scope (Regime III) rather than “violated.”

Step 2 (admissibility). On regions where BC2 passes, require that the induced retarded influence of any local intervention be supported only inside the operational future determined by the induced characteristic structure (IV.B). Equivalently, enforce the microcausality admissibility gate used throughout the manuscript: the induced operator family must be hyperbolic/well-posed on Ω.

Operational statement: microcausality is not asserted as a property of a pre-existing spacetime; it is a filter selecting which induced effective descriptions on 𝓜 are admissible at all.

(Interface rule: “no GR/QFT language before gates”). Any statement phrased in GR/QFT language (metric, curvature, commutators, horizons) is permitted only after the relevant BC gates pass; before that, only (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦, Π, ν_Θ)-level statements are meaningful.

Why this matters now. Several active bottlenecks in quantum-gravity-adjacent work are increasingly *engineering* rather than purely conceptual, and PCT is structured to unblock them in a way that is auditable. (i) **Turning “emergence” claims into discriminator-ready, null-tested analyses:** the field has many emergence narratives but fewer agreed decision procedures; here the step-vs-smooth discriminator is specified as an executable protocol (IV.A.5a) and consolidated into a single falsification checklist with thresholds and null controls (V.Z), with a concrete GW implementation target (V.G.15 + Appendix C). (ii) **Estimator-stable dimensional diagnostics across discrete/graph surrogates:** spectral-dimension results are often sensitive to discretization and differentiation/smoothing choices; this manuscript standardizes the heat-trace/step extraction pipeline (IV.A.5–IV.A.5a) and provides an end-to-end worked numerical instance and robustness structure (V.B; V.J), anchored by a reusable reference implementation (PCT/pct_ds.py). (iii) **Discipline around “when GR/QFT language applies” in pregeometric models:** reviewers increasingly reject frameworks that slide between levels; the scope-gate rule and BC1–BC5 reporting requirement (Introduction; IV.A–IV.D) make correspondence statements explicitly conditional, so failures are localized (a gate fails) rather than diffused into unfalsifiable rhetoric.

Section II. FOUNDATIONS 
This section establishes the foundational structure of Projective Correlation Theory (PCT) as a pregeometric framework. The central claim is that neither spacetime nor matter constitutes the most fundamental level of physical description. Instead, both emerge from a deeper level of organisation based on correlations subject to global consistency constraints. In contrast to approaches that take spacetime, fields, or quantum states as primitive, PCT treats correlation and compatibility as ontologically primary, with geometry and material degrees of freedom arising only after projection. 
FOUNDATIONAL CLARIFICATIONS 
PCT does not explain gravity by spacetime correlations. It explains spacetime itself as a stable projection of correlation constraints. The projection rules are not chosen to reproduce GR; GR-like behavior appears as a fixed point under broad constraint classes. 
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── PRIMITIVE STRUCTURES (inputs): 
• Correlation kernel K(u,v) on 𝒦 — symmetric, positive semi-definite 
• Consistency/compatibility constraints — which configurations can coexist 
• Microclass axioms M1–M5 — stability and convergence requirements 

Network/simplicial interpretation (optional concrete realisation). Many PCT instantiations can be represented as discrete compatibility structures: take u ∈ 𝒦 as nodes of a weighted graph with edge weights w(u,v)=K(u,v), and interpret coarse geometric regularity as a constraint on the graph’s spectral/mesoscopic properties (as diagnosed downstream by d_s(ℓ) and manifold-likeness tests). If pairwise compatibility is insufficient to stabilise manifold-like reconstructions in a given class of examples, higher-order joint compatibility can be introduced via simplicial weights (e.g., K₃(u,v,w) and higher), with K as the induced 1-skeleton/marginal; this is treated as an admissible extension (a different PCT variant) provided it preserves the microclass/admissibility constraints (M1–M5, Λ-constraints, and microcausality).
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── EMERGENT AS STABILITY ATTRACTORS (not inputs): 
• Lorentz symmetry — unique stable fixed point of correlation dynamics (V.Q) 
• Dimensionality D=4 — follows from kernel symmetry under M4 
• Causal structure — from Z_t/Z_s deformation asymmetry 
• Metric g_μν — derived from correlation decay (Theorem 5) 
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── WHAT DOES NOT EXIST AT THE BASE LEVEL: 
• No spacetime — 𝓜 is initially a label space, not a manifold with geometry 
• No metric — g_μν emerges from correlation structure 
• No locality — correlations on 𝒦 are global; locality emerges after projection 
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
ON THE PROJECTION MEDIATOR Λ (OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS): 
Λ is deliberately underspecified in *form*, but not in *admissibility*: in the rigorous formulation Λ is identified with a probability measure ν_Θ on the projection-parameter space Θ (III.D.3). The following constraints are required; anything outside them is not PCT as defined in this manuscript. 

Λ-1 (Measurability / well-posedness). Θ must be a measurable space and ν_Θ must be a countably additive probability measure on (Θ, Σ_Θ). The induced projection kernel Π(·|u;θ) must be measurable in θ and u (so that pushforwards and integrals in G₂ are well-defined). 

Λ-2 (Normalization). ν_Θ(Θ) = 1 and for all (u,θ), Π(·|u;θ) is a normalized probability measure on 𝓜. (Violations break the operational meaning of “projection selection” and destroy the Born-volume construction.) 

Λ-3 (Continuity / robustness class). Small changes in θ (in the topology on Θ relevant to the chosen model instantiation) must not produce discontinuous changes in θ-invariant observables in generic regimes (i.e., outside explicitly defined critical transitions such as the κ-discontinuity module). Operationally: for any admissible neighborhood U in Θ, ν_Θ(U)>0 and observable reconstructions (e.g., d_s plateaus, weak-field redshift scaling) remain stable under small perturbations of ν_Θ supported in U. 

Λ-4 (Factorization / no-signaling admissibility). For emergent regions that are A-spacelike separated (Section IV.B), admissible Π and ν_Θ must not allow controllable dependence of local marginals on spacelike-separated settings. In practice, Π must satisfy the factorization/no-signaling constraint described in V.U (Π factorizes appropriately for spacelike separations), and Λ must not reintroduce signaling by correlating θ-selections in a way that enables superluminal control in 𝓜. 

Λ-5 (Microclass compatibility). The induced model (𝒦, K, Π, Λ) must lie in the microclass 𝒨 (M1–M5), including kernel regularity (M1), projection normalization/consistency (M2), mediator normalization (M3), correlation-distance compatibility (M4), and spectral convergence (M5). 

Within these constraints, Λ is intentionally free (underspecified) to keep the framework robust to microscopic details while preserving falsifiable, θ-invariant outputs. 
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── GR QUANTITIES AS EXTERNAL OBSERVABLES: 
Mass, energy, curvature, horizons are not internal to PCT—they are labels for structures that appear after projection into 𝓜. 
They are "what an observer using GR language would call" the projected correlation patterns. 
The motivation for this framework is twofold. First, contemporary physics lacks a unified account of the origin of spacetime itself. Quantum mechanics presupposes an external time parameter, while general relativity presupposes a differentiable manifold; neither theory explains why such a structure exists. Second, quantum correlations—most prominently entanglement—exhibit nonlocal features that resist interpretation within a strictly spacetime-based ontology. These issues suggest that spacetime may be an emergent construct rather than a fundamental arena. 
PCT advances a non-naive realist position: the underlying pregeometric structure is taken to be real and observerindependent, while observed spacetime phenomena depend on how that structure is projected under specific compatibility conditions. Observers do not create reality but select, through interaction, a particular consistent projection of an underlying correlation structure. 
The framework is based on the following **minimal axioms** (3–6 total) stated without GR/QFT interpretation. Everything else in the manuscript is either (i) a definition built from these axioms, (ii) a derived consequence conditional on explicit regularity/admissibility assumptions, or (iii) a stipulated/locked/calibrated choice.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MINIMAL AXIOMS (PCT)

Axiom A1 (Primitive object set).
There exist primitive objects
  (𝒦,\ K,\ ρ_𝒦,\ Θ,\ ν_Θ,\ Π)
where 𝒦 and Θ are measurable spaces, ρ_𝒦 is a nonnegative measurable population/weight on 𝒦, K is a symmetric PSD kernel on 𝒦, ν_Θ is a probability measure on Θ, and Π(\cdot|u;θ) is a Markov kernel from (𝒦×Θ) to 𝓜.

Axiom A2 (Projection-only observables).
All claims about “physical observables” are statements about objects on 𝓜 constructed from the primitive tuple in A1 (pushforwards/conditionals and their θ-invariant summaries). No spacetime metric g_{μν}, matter fields, or QFT states are primitives.

Axiom A3 (Admissibility is part of the theory, not an external add-on).
Only those primitive tuples that satisfy an explicit admissibility filter are “PCT models” in the sense of this manuscript. Concretely, admissibility is enforced by the microclass axioms (M1–M5) and mediator constraints (Λ-1…Λ-5) introduced later; outside those constraints is *not* PCT-as-defined-here.

Axiom A4 (Operational interface: preparations/transformations/measurements).
Laboratory-level statements are represented by (i) admissible changes in ρ_𝒦 and/or admissible changes in the projection sector (Π,ν_Θ), and (ii) record-stabilizing coarse-grainings on 𝓜 (V.T). “Measurement” is therefore a stability/selection rule on admissible projection sectors, not a primitive collapse postulate.

Axiom A5 (Scope-gated interpretation rule).
Any use of GR/QFT language is *licensed only after* the relevant regime gates (BC1–BC5) are reported as PASS on a stated region Ω ⊂ 𝓜 and scale window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁]. If the required gates are not reported, the statement is out of scope by definition (Introduction scope gate; Definition III.F.2).

Axiom A6 (Background independence / auxiliary-structure discipline).
PCT is *background independent* in the following precise, scoped sense:

(A6.1) No background spacetime structure is primitive.
No metric, connection, topology, coordinate chart, or causal order on 𝓜 is assumed at the fundamental level. 𝓜 is initially only a measurable label space; geometric/causal structures on 𝓜 are derived (and only interpreted) after regime gates pass.

(A6.2) Auxiliary structures may be introduced only as *bookkeeping*.
Any additional structures introduced to state regularity, compute approximations, or run numerics (e.g., a pseudo-metric d_𝒦, discretizations, coordinate charts, Laplacian conventions, smoothing/derivative windows) are *auxiliary* and must not change θ-invariant observables in the declared regime; if they do, the dependence must be labeled explicitly as “scheme/auxiliary-choice dependence” (V.J; parameter ledger) and the claim downgraded accordingly.

(A6.3) Physical content is carried by θ-invariant outputs.
Only θ-invariant observables on 𝓜 (and their regime-gated applicability conditions) count as physical; all representational degrees of freedom (θ-gauge, relabelings of 𝓜, coordinate choices on Ω) are treated as nonphysical.

Demonstration (auxiliary-structure invariance; what is and is not invariant).
The point of A6 is not rhetorical; it is a precise invariance statement about the reconstruction map.

Proposition BI-1 (𝓜-relabeling invariance of the reconstruction map).
Let φ: 𝓜 → 𝓜 be a measurable bijection (a relabeling of the emergent label space), and define the relabeled projection kernel Π_φ by pushforward:
  Π_φ(A|u;θ) := Π(φ^{-1}(A)|u;θ)  for measurable A ⊆ 𝓜.
Then the induced correlator satisfies G_{2,φ}(x,y;θ)=G_2(φ^{-1}(x),φ^{-1}(y);θ), and the normalized correlator Ĝ₂ (eqIV.A.2) is preserved under relabeling; therefore any θ-invariant observable built from Ĝ₂ and the heat-trace of L_ρ (e.g., d_s(ℓ) as a function of ℓ, step/non-step decisions, and any dimensionless ratios formed inside a fixed regime gate) is unchanged up to the same relabeling.
Interpretation: no coordinate chart or labeling of 𝓜 is a background structure for PCT; only equivalence classes under relabeling/diffeomorphism matter when BC1 permits manifold language.

Proposition BI-2 (𝒦-auxiliary-metric nondependence at the primitive level).
In the continuum formulation, an auxiliary metric/pseudometric d_𝒦 may be introduced on 𝒦 to state kernel regularity/decay (III.D.1, III.D.4). This auxiliary choice is not physical: if two such choices d_𝒦 and d_𝒦' yield the same primitive kernel K (as a measurable function on 𝒦×𝒦) and the same measure-theoretic structure (Σ_𝒦, μ_𝒦), then the induced correlators G₂ and all downstream θ-invariant outputs are identical.

Proposition BI-3 (explicit list of unavoidable auxiliary choices).
Some auxiliary choices are unavoidable for *computation* and must be tracked explicitly. In this manuscript they include:
• (Aux-1) Regularity scaffolding on 𝒦: a pseudo-metric/topology d_𝒦 used only to state continuity/decay assumptions for K.
• (Aux-2) Discretization/scheme choices: graph/Laplacian convention, trace estimator (eig vs Hutchinson), smoothing/derivative windows for d_s(ℓ), and step-extraction rule.
• (Aux-3) Proxy conventions linking principal-symbol data to a familiar GR form (e.g., g_tt:=−1/Z_t, g_rr:=1/Z_s; and when invoked the convention g_tt g_rr=−1).
The reporting rule is: if a main numerical claim depends on any Aux-* item beyond trivial tolerances, the claim must be marked as scheme-dependent and its stability must be demonstrated under at least one admissible swap/refinement (V.J; V.Z).

Distinction Between Correlation Types 
Two distinct but related forms of correlation are present in the framework: 
Pregeometric correlations, encoded by the kernel (𝐾) on (𝒦), which relate admissible states of the correlation node. 
Projected correlations, which relate the emergent entities appearing in (𝓜) after application of Π. 
Projected correlations inherit their structure from pregeometric correlations but are constrained by the dimensionality and geometry of (𝓜). Entanglement in spacetime corresponds to multiple projected degrees of freedom sharing a common origin in a single configuration of (𝒦). 
Emergent Manifold and Dimensionality 
The emergent manifold (𝓜) is the effective domain in which spacetime and matter appear. No assumption is made that (𝓜) must be four-dimensional at the fundamental level. Instead, its dimensionality is determined by the structure of admissible projections. Empirically, observed physics is well described by a four-dimensional effective manifold, which in this framework corresponds to a projection that yields three geometric dimensions and one ordering parameter associated with irreversible change. 
The framework allows both minimal and maximal dimensionality bounds. Minimally, (𝓜) must support sufficient structure to encode causal ordering and relational localisation. Maximally, additional emergent dimensions may appear but remain inaccessible if suppressed by projection constraints. The apparent four-dimensionality of spacetime is therefore interpreted as a consequence of stability and consistency, not as a fundamental necessity. 
Paradox Tolerance and Pregeometric Logic 
The hyperverse described by (𝒦) is not required to obey classical spacetime logic. In particular, incompatibilities or apparent paradoxes at the pregeometric level are admissible provided that the projection (𝛱) yields a consistent emergent manifold (𝓜). Consistency is enforced at the level of projections, not at the level of the hyperverse itself. This permits the underlying structure to be more permissive than classical logic while preserving empirical coherence. 
Minimal Mathematical Framework 
At this stage, the minimal mathematical elements required for formal development are: 
- A set or manifold (𝒦) representing admissible correlation node states. 
- A correlation kernel (𝐾: 𝒦 × 𝒦 → ℝ₊) encoding compatibility. 
- A projection kernel Π(\cdot|u;θ) from 𝒦 to 𝓜 (a Markov kernel), with deterministic maps Π_det: 𝒦 → 𝓜 as a special case. 
- A projection mediator Λ specifying the admissible projection-parameter measure (ν_Θ on Θ). 
No *physical* metric, topology, or causal structure is assumed a priori on (𝒦). For the purposes of measure theory and convergence, one may equip 𝒦 with auxiliary structures (e.g., a σ-algebra and a pseudo-metric generating a workable topology), but these are bookkeeping/regularity devices and are not interpreted as spacetime geometry. Physical geometric structure (including the operational metric used by observers) emerges only on (𝓜) after projection. This completes the foundational specification required to proceed to formal modelling. 
Preparation for Formal Development 
Section III will introduce explicit mathematical realizations of the above structures, including finite and continuum models, probability measures, and dynamical rules. Numerical simulations and illustrative examples will be presented in appendices. The present section establishes the ontological and conceptual foundations upon which that formal development is built. 
Section III. FORMALISATION 
Purpose of Formalisation: In Section II, we discussed the concepts of correlation and projection in qualitative terms. We now formalize these ideas in mathematical language to clarify their structure and relationships. The goal is to establish a clear algebraic framework that captures how hyperstates (underlying states of a system, subject to certain constraints) relate to emergent states (the higher-level outcomes or configurations we observe), and how a measure of correlation can quantify the compatibility between different hyperstates. This formal foundation will later allow us to incorporate probabilistic interpretations (in Section III.B), but for now we keep the discussion deterministic and combinatorial. 
III.A. Core definitions: 
We introduce the key constructs of our framework as follows: 
Constraint Manifold 𝒦_fin: This is the finite set of all admissible hyperstates under the given constraints. Formally, we can write 𝒦_fin = {𝑐1, 𝑐2, … , 𝑐𝑁}, where each 𝑐𝑖 is a specific hyperstate of the system that satisfies the constraints outlined in Section II. We refer to 𝒦_fin as a "manifold" in the sense of a state-space of possibilities (here it is a discrete set rather than a continuous geometric manifold). The finiteness of 𝒦_fin reflects a toy-model assumption for simplicity – it contains a limited number of distinct hyperstates that we consider in our illustrative scenario. 
Projection Kernel Π: For the general theory, the projection is represented by a Markov kernel Π(\cdot|u;θ) from 𝒦 to 𝓜. In this finite toy-model subsection, we use the deterministic special case Π_det: 𝒦_fin → ℳ. By deterministic, we mean that for each hyperstate 𝑐 ∈ 𝒦_fin there is a single well-defined image 𝑚 = Π_det(𝑐) ∈ ℳ. The emergent manifold ℳ = {𝑚1, 𝑚2, … , 𝑚n} is the set of distinct emergent configurations or outcomes that can result from the underlying hyperstates. In effect, Π_det partitions 𝒦_fin into groups (fibers of Π_det), where all hyperstates in a given group map to the same emergent state. If two hyperstates 𝑐𝑖, 𝑐𝑗 ∈ 𝒦_fin map to the same 𝑚 ∈ ℳ (i.e. Π_det(𝑐𝑖) = Π_det(𝑐𝑗) = 𝑚), we interpret this as 𝑐𝑖 and 𝑐𝑗 being different micro-level realizations of the same macro-level outcome. Importantly, Π_det is surjective onto ℳ if every emergent state actually occurs as the image of some hyperstate (we will typically assume this, so that ℳ represents the set of realized outcomes). 
Correlation Kernel 𝑲: The correlation kernel 𝐾 is a function that assigns a nonnegative real number to each pair of hyperstates, quantifying their compatibility or correlation. Formally, 𝐾: 𝒦_fin × 𝒦_fin → ℝ≥0. This kernel is symmetric, meaning 𝐾(𝑐𝑖, 𝑐𝑗) = 𝐾(𝑐𝑗, 𝑐𝑖) for any 𝑐𝑖, 𝑐𝑗 ∈ 𝒦_fin. We can think of 𝐾(𝑐𝑖, 𝑐𝑗) as a measure of how strongly hyperstate 𝑐𝑖 "aligns with" or "is consistent with" hyperstate 𝑐𝑗 under the given constraints. A larger value of 𝐾(𝑐𝑖, 𝑐𝑗) indicates a higher degree of compatibility or correlation between those two hyperstates, while a value of 0 would indicate that the two hyperstates are completely incompatible (cannot co-occur or have no overlap in the context of the theory). We require 𝐾(𝑐𝑖, 𝑐𝑖) ≥ 0 for all 𝑖 (often one may set 𝐾(𝑐𝑖, 𝑐𝑖) = 1 to normalize self-correlation, but the formalism does not demand a particular normalization at this stage). It’s important to note that 𝐾 is an abstract kernel defining pairwise relationships; at this stage we do not interpret 𝐾 as a probability or an inner product – it is simply a nonnegative weight or score. Any probabilistic interpretation (such as relating 𝐾 to transition amplitudes or the Born rule for measurement outcomes) is deferred to Section III.B. For now, 𝐾 serves as a tool to identify patterns of correlation among hyperstates in 𝒦_fin. 
In summary, 𝒦_fin is the space of fine-grained states we consider possible, ℳ is the space of emergent outcomes, 𝛱 links these levels by projecting each fine-grained state to a coarse-grained state, and 𝐾 provides a quantitative measure of how any two fine-grained states relate to each other under our model’s constraints. All of these constructs are defined algebraically as sets, functions, and mappings; we have not introduced any geometric structure or probabilistic rules yet. This separation ensures that the structural relationships are established first, providing a solid foundation on which physical interpretations (like probabilities and measurement postulates) can be added subsequently. 
Finite Toy Model Example 
To make these abstractions more concrete, let us consider a simple toy model with a very small, finite constraint manifold. Suppose 𝒦_fin = {𝑐1, 𝑐2, 𝑐3, 𝑐4} consists of four distinct hyperstates. We will illustrate the correlation structure and the projection mapping for this toy model. 
Fig.1 
Graph representation of the toy constraint manifold 𝒦_fin with four hyperstates. Nodes 𝑐1, 𝑐2, 𝑐3, 𝑐4 are hyperstates, and an edge between two nodes indicates a nonzero correlation 𝐾(𝑐𝑖, 𝑐𝑗). Here we assign strong correlations (compatibility) to the pair 𝑐1, 𝑐2 and to the pair 𝑐3, 𝑐4, as indicated by the edges labeled 𝐾 = 1. No edge connects nodes from different pairs, reflecting 𝐾(𝑐𝑖, 𝑐𝑗) = 0 for any one 𝑐𝑖 in the set {𝑐1, 𝑐2} and another 𝑐𝑗 in {𝑐3, 𝑐4}. Thus, the hyperstates naturally form two disjoint clusters of mutual compatibility under this kernel. In this graph-based depiction of 𝒦_fin, the edge weights come from our correlation kernel 𝐾. By construction, 𝐾(𝑐1, 𝑐2) = 𝐾(𝑐2, 𝑐1) = 1 and 𝐾(𝑐3, 𝑐4) = 𝐾(𝑐4, 𝑐3) = 1, indicating maximal correlation within each of the two pairs, while all other pairings have 𝐾 = 0. This simple correlation pattern captures the idea that 𝑐1 is highly compatible with 𝑐2 (they might represent two nearly equivalent descriptions or micro-configurations that differ only in irrelevant details), and similarly 𝑐3 is compatible with 𝑐4. In contrast, any state in the first pair is incompatible with any state in the second pair according to 𝐾 (perhaps reflecting that they lead to different outcomes or violate a constraint if taken together). 
Now we define the emergent manifold and the projection map for this toy model. Let the emergent manifold be ℳ = {𝑚1, 𝑚2}, containing two emergent states. We specify 𝛱: 𝒦_fin → ℳ in a way that mirrors the clustering suggested by 𝐾. In particular, choose the projection such that: 
Π_det(𝑐1) = Π_det(𝑐2) = 𝑚1,   Π_det(𝑐3) = Π_det(𝑐4) = 𝑚2 . 
In words, hyperstates 𝑐1 and 𝑐2 are both mapped to the emergent state 𝑚1, and hyperstates 𝑐3 and 𝑐4 are mapped to emergent state 𝑚2. Under this mapping, the constraint manifold 𝒦_fin is partitioned into two subsets: {𝑐1, 𝑐2} which corresponds to emergent configuration 𝑚1, and {𝑐3, 𝑐4} corresponding to 𝑚2. Deterministically, if the system’s hyperstate is either 𝑐1 or 𝑐2, an observer at the emergent level will see outcome 𝑚1; if the hyperstate is 𝑐3 or 𝑐4, the outcome will be 𝑚2. The projection 𝛱 thus encapsulates the idea that multiple distinct micro-level states can lead to the same macro-level state. Each emergent state 𝑚 ∈ ℳ can be identified with an equivalence class of hyperstates in 𝒦_fin (the preimage 𝛱−1(𝑚)), and in our example these classes are {𝑐1, 𝑐2} and {𝑐3, 𝑐4}. 
Crucially, this toy model demonstrates how the correlation kernel and projection map work in tandem. 
Hyperstates that are strongly correlated (high 𝐾 value) end up being grouped together by the projection 𝛱 into the same emergent outcome. In our example, because 𝐾 indicated that 𝑐1 correlates with 𝑐2 (and 𝑐3 with 𝑐4), it made sense to define 𝛱 such that 𝑐1, 𝑐2 → 𝑚1 and 𝑐3, 𝑐4 → 𝑚2. One could say that the correlation structure on 𝒞 provides a rationale for why certain hyperstates should be identified with the same emergent state. Conversely, the projection map 𝛱 imposes a classification on hyperstates, and the kernel 𝐾 can be used to check which hyperstates within a class are mutually compatible or how strongly hyperstates from different classes differ. All of this remains in the realm of set-theoretic, algebraic description: we have not yet introduced any probabilities, wavefunctions, or geometric spaces. The hyperstates and emergent states are just labels with specified relationships (via 𝐾 and 𝛱), and the numbers from 𝐾 are abstract correlation scores. 
No Probabilistic Interpretation Yet: It is important to emphasize that at this stage we are not making any statistical or probabilistic assertions. The mapping 𝛱 is deterministic (one hyperstate maps to one outcome without randomness), and the kernel 𝐾(𝑐𝑖, 𝑐𝑗) is a fixed compatibility score (not a probability or amplitude). We are laying down a formal scaffold that will support physical interpretation in the next part of the paper. In Section III.B, we will introduce a probabilistic interpretation on top of this structure — for example, using something analogous to the Born rule to connect the correlation kernel 𝐾 with actual probabilities of observing 𝑚1 or 𝑚2 given certain conditions. However, by deferring those concepts, we ensure that the mathematical relationships are clear: we can see how correlation and projection alone (in an algebraic sense) organize the possible states and outcomes. This separation of concerns allows us to pinpoint where randomness and probabilities enter the theory (in Section III.B), distinct from the deterministic backbone provided by 𝒞, 𝛱, and 𝐾 defined here.

III.B. Projection Map and Emergent Correlation Structure 
In Projective Correlation Theory, familiar spacetime and fields—represented as an emergent manifold 𝓜—arise from a deeper pregeometric framework called the constraint manifold 𝒦. This emergence is accomplished by a projection kernel Π that connects the two levels of description. Unlike a simple deterministic map, Π defines a propensity distribution, reflecting the fact that pregeometric states have a potential to realize different emergent configurations until a measurement interaction occurs. In this section, we explain how Π interacts with the correlation structure of 𝒦—mediated by a projection mediator Λ—to yield emergent geometric and quantum features in 𝓜. We describe how the correlation kernel 𝐾 in 𝒦 determines the effective geometry of 𝓜, and how different projection orientations parametrized by an angle θ lead to distinct emergent configurations. To build intuition, we introduce graphical representations (such as correlation graphs and their projected “shadows”) to visualize how quantum entanglement, field modes, and curvature emerge from the underlying correlation structure. We conclude with a summary distinguishing the pregeometric dynamics in 𝒦 from the emergent observables in 𝓜, highlighting how the internal update interval τ_int of 𝒦 relates to the flow of time in the emergent picture. 
 
 
Projection Map Π, Constraint Manifold 𝒦, and Mediator Λ 
The constraint manifold 𝒦 is an abstract, high-dimensional space encoding the fundamental degrees of freedom and constraints of the theory. It can be thought of as the “stage” on which elemental units of information— sometimes called correlation nodes Ж—reside and interact. These correlation nodes are not particles in the usual sense; rather, each Ж represents a fundamental pregeometric entity (e.g. a Planck-scale “grain” of information or quantum state) that carries internal states and relationships to other correlation nodes. Crucially, correlation nodes in 𝒦 are interconnected by an intricate pattern of correlations, reflecting fundamental quantum relationships prior to any notion of space or time. The manifold 𝒦 is termed “constraint” because the configuration of Ж’s and their correlations must satisfy certain foundational constraints (for instance, conservation principles or self-consistency conditions that define the allowed pregeometric states). These constraints ensure that not every imaginable configuration in 𝒦 is realized—only those that can give rise to a coherent emergent reality in 𝓜. 
The projection map Π formalizes how the rich, high-dimensional data in 𝒦 is mapped into the lower-dimensional structure of 𝓜 (the emergent spacetime manifold). One can imagine Π as a mathematical mapping or functional that “projects” the state of the correlation node network onto emergent degrees of freedom (such as fields, particles, and geometry in ordinary spacetime). By design, Π is non-invertible and many-to-one: many distinct microstates in 𝒦 may correspond to the same emergent configuration in 𝓜. This reflects the idea that 𝓜 captures only coarse-grained, effective information while discarding or averaging over the underlying detail. The projection map operates subject to the constraints in 𝒦, meaning Π must respect the fundamental rules of the pregeometric framework (e.g. it cannot violate a correlation conservation law). In practical terms, applying Π to a state of 𝒦 yields a projected state in 𝓜 — populating 𝓜 with effective points, fields, and other observables that we identify as physical reality. Intuitively, Π can be likened to shining a light through a complex high-dimensional object (the 𝒦 structure) to cast a shadow in lower dimensions (the 𝓜 structure). What appears in the shadow (𝓜) is determined by both the object’s internal structure (correlations in 𝒦) and the angle or manner of projection. 
The projection mediator Λ plays the role of an intermediary that facilitates this mapping. In the projection analogy of a light casting a shadow, Λ would correspond to the lens or screen that ensures the projection is consistent and well-defined. More formally, Λ encapsulates any additional degrees of freedom or fields that are required for the projection to occur without breaking the constraints of 𝒦. For example, if certain correlation information cannot be directly mapped onto 𝓜, Λ might carry or encode that information implicitly—ensuring that the influence of pregeometric correlations is correctly transferred into the emergent picture. One may think of Λ as a mediator field or operator that couples the two layers: it “listens” to the state of 𝒦 and influences the formation of structures in 𝓜 accordingly. The projection map Π thus does not act alone; it operates in tandem with Λ to satisfy two requirements: (1) the consistency condition (ensuring that the emergent 𝓜 state is a valid image of some 𝒦 state under the constraints) and (2) the completeness condition (ensuring that all physically relevant information from 𝒦 that should influence 𝓜 is properly accounted for in the projection). In summary, Π provides the rule for mapping 𝒦 to 𝓜, 𝒦 supplies the raw correlated structure to be mapped, and Λ guarantees the mapping proceeds in a way that honors the underlying constraints and symmetries. 
Correlation Kernel 𝐾 and Emergent Geometry 
A central element in this framework is the correlation kernel 𝐾, which quantitatively characterizes the web of connections among correlation nodes in 𝒦. The kernel 𝐾 can be thought of as a function or matrix: for any pair of correlation nodes (Ж_i, Ж_j) in the constraint manifold, 𝐾(Ж_i, Ж_j) measures the strength (and possibly the phase or sign) of their correlation. These correlations are fundamentally quantum-mechanical in origin— encompassing entanglement, shared quantum numbers, or other pregeometric linkages between the correlation nodes. In effect, 𝐾 encodes the architecture of the underlying network: which correlation nodes are strongly correlated with each other and which are only weakly so. One can imagine a correlation graph (see Fig. 1) where each node represents a correlation node Ж and each weighted edge between nodes represents the correlation strength given by 𝐾. This graph is a convenient visualization of 𝐾, depicting a highly connected, intricate network at the Planck-scale. Importantly, 𝐾 is not static; it can evolve over the internal time of 𝒦, and its evolution drives changes in the emergent manifold 𝓜. 
The profound role of 𝐾 is that it determines the emergent geometry perceived in 𝓜. In ordinary general relativity, the geometry of spacetime (its metric curvature) is shaped by energy and matter; here, in the projective correlation framework, geometry is shaped by the pattern of correlations. Intuitively, one postulates that distance in 𝓜 is inversely related to correlation in 𝒦: correlation nodes that are strongly correlated (high 𝐾 value) will be “close” or even coincident in the emergent manifold, whereas those with negligible correlation will appear far apart. In a rough sense, the correlation kernel acts like a metric generator. If we were to “embed” the correlation graph into a smooth continuum, the lengths of edges (or effective distances between nodes) would be set by the weights (1/𝐾 or some monotonic inverse of 𝐾). For a simple example, if 𝐾 decays with some parameter (analogous to an interaction range), that decay could set an emergent length scale. A nearly uniform 𝐾 across the network would produce an approximately flat, homogeneous spacetime manifold (no preferred locations or curvature), whereas variations or gradients in 𝐾 across the network translate to curvature and inhomogeneity in 𝓜. Thus, a tightly knit cluster of correlation nodes in 𝒦 (many strong inter-correlations) might project to a localized region of 𝓜 with a high concentration of effective “points” or energy—perceivable as a mass that curves the surrounding space. Conversely, a sparse or weakly connected region in the correlation network would manifest as a lowdensity, possibly flat region of spacetime. 
Mathematically, one could imagine extracting an effective metric g_μν on 𝓜 from the kernel 𝐾. While we avoid heavy equations here, conceptually this could be achieved by interpreting 𝐾 as a kind of kernel for a distance measure or as the fundamental two-point function of a pregeometric state. For instance, if one defines a distance D(i,j) between emergent points i and j such that D ∼ f(1/𝐾(Ж_i, Ж_j)) for some function f, then 𝐾’s structure dictates all the spatial relationships in 𝓜. In this way, curvature in 𝓜 (deviations from flat Euclidean or Minkowski space) arise when 𝐾 cannot be realized as a constant across the network. If 𝐾 has complex topology or clustering, the resulting 𝓜 might have higher-dimensional features or extra structure beyond simple smooth space. In summary, the correlation kernel 𝐾 is the blueprint of emergent geometry: it tells us which points of 𝓜 end up neighboring each other, how distances contract or dilate, and where curvature forms, all derived from the underlying correlation data among correlation nodes in 𝒦. 
Projection Orientations and the Angle θ 
The process of projection from 𝒦 to 𝓜 is not unique—critically, it can be oriented or configured in multiple ways. We introduce an angle θ to parametrize the projection orientation in an abstract projection space. Here θ does not necessarily refer to a literal angle in physical space, but rather a tunable parameter (or set of parameters) that describes how the information in 𝒦 is sliced or aligned when mapping to 𝓜. Different values of θ correspond to different “views” or perspectives of the underlying 𝒦 structure. Continuing the shadow analogy: if Π acts like a lamp casting a shadow of the correlation node network, then changing θ is like rotating the lamp or shifting the screen. The overall structure of the shadow (emergent 𝓜) can change qualitatively with different orientations, even though the underlying object (the correlation network in 𝒦) remains the same. 
In physical terms, θ could label different sectors or configurations of emergent physics. For example, one orientation of projection might emphasize a certain subset of correlations—yielding an emergent universe with particular constants or symmetry properties—whereas another orientation might highlight different aspects of 𝐾, leading to a universe with altered effective laws. One might speculate that varying θ could switch which combinations of correlation node degrees of freedom map to familiar concepts like space vs. internal gauge fields. In one orientation, a certain pattern of correlations might manifest predominantly as geometric curvature; in another orientation, that same pattern could appear as a field excitation or particle content. Thus, θ provides a way to parametrically explore the landscape of emergent realities derivable from the same 𝒦. 
It’s also useful to consider θ in dynamical terms: if the projection orientation were to change over time (say θ = θ(t) as an internal parameter evolving with 𝒦’'s dynamics), the emergent manifold 𝓜 would experience what we might call an orientation update. Small continuous changes in θ could correspond to smooth transformations in the emergent physical laws (an intriguing possibility, though one would expect such changes to be highly constrained to not contradict observed stability of physics). In a more static sense, θ might label different solutions or phases of the theory—much like how different solutions to Einstein’s equations correspond to different spacetimes. Here, they correspond to different ways of projecting the same fundamental correlation structure. In summary, θ serves as a dial on the projector Π, determining the orientation or basis in which the rich tapestry of 𝒦 is viewed. By setting θ appropriately, the projection mediator Λ and map Π together pick out the slice of 𝒦 that will be recognized as the emergent manifold 𝓜, selecting which correlations become proximity, which become fields, and so forth. 
Graphical Representation and Emergent Phenomena 
To better grasp these abstract ideas, it helps to visualize the correlation structure and its projection. Correlation graphs and projection shadows offer two complementary pictures. A correlation graph (see Fig. 1) depicts the pregeometric world: nodes represent correlation nodes Ж in the constraint manifold, and edges between nodes illustrate nonzero correlations (with thicker or darker edges for higher 𝐾 values). This graph may look highly complex—potentially every Ж is connected to many others, forming a dense web. Certain clusters or communities of nodes might be apparent, indicating groups of correlation nodes that are strongly mutually correlated. The graph might also show hubs (nodes with exceptionally many strong connections) or other network structures. Although 𝒦 is a continuous manifold conceptually, the graph visualization treats a discretized picture for illustration, which is reasonable if 𝒦 is thought to have a countable basis (e.g., a finite or countably infinite set of fundamental elements). This correlation graph encapsulates the raw “pre-spacetime” structure of reality in the theory. 
In contrast, a projection shadow (see Fig. 2) illustrates the outcome of applying the projection map Π (with a chosen orientation θ) to that graph. Imagine we “shine a light” through the correlation graph of Fig. 1: the shadow is what appears in emergent space 𝓜. In this shadow representation, points in the figure correspond to emergent entities (particles, field excitations, or simply points of spacetime), and their arrangement in the diagram corresponds to distances and relationships in 𝓜. If two emergent points lie close together in the shadow, it means the projection has placed them near each other in 𝓜—typically because their corresponding correlation nodes in 𝒦 were strongly correlated. Lines or shading in the shadow can be used to indicate field values or other continuum properties that emerged. For instance, a continuous field in 𝓜 might appear as a smoothly varying color or intensity across the shadow, reflecting collective patterns of correlation from the graph. The projection shadow thus translates the discrete network into a continuum-like image: clusters of tightly connected correlation nodes become contiguous regions in space, extensive correlation loops might appear as continuous fields or fluxes, and areas of sparse correlation become voids or empty space. Any distortions or warps in the shadow (like bending of straight lines, clustering of points, etc.) indicate emergent curvature or forces in 𝓜 resulting from nonuniformities in the underlying correlation network. 
Within this correlation-based view, several key physical phenomena find natural explanation: 
- Quantum Entanglement: In emergent 𝓜, quantum entanglement between distinct particles or field modes appears as a direct shadow of pregeometric correlations. If two particles in 𝓜 are observed to be entangled, it is because they originate from correlation nodes or groups of correlation nodes in 𝒦 that share strong correlation links. In the correlation graph (Fig. 1), entangled emergent particles correspond to nodes that were closely connected (perhaps even overlapping communities) in the underlying network. Thus, what looks mysterious in spacetime—distant particles exhibiting coordinated states—simply reflects a unity at the 𝒦 level (they were never truly separate in the pregeometric sense). This framework suggests that entanglement is not an added structure on top of spacetime, but rather built-in to spacetime’s construction: space is literally woven from entanglement. Seen in the projection shadow, an entangled pair might be drawn as two distant points in 𝓜 with a dashed line or subtle highlighting indicating a “short-circuit” connection through 𝒦 (i.e., a connection not visible as an ordinary spatial path in 𝓜, but existing in the correlation graph). In essence, the correlation structure provides a global connectivity that can make far-apart points in 𝓜 behave as one, yielding entanglement and nonlocal quantum correlations as a natural facet of emergent physics. 
- Field Modes: What we perceive as classical or quantum fields in 𝓜 (such as electromagnetic or scalar fields) correspond to collective modes of the correlation network in 𝒦. A field mode can be envisioned as a pattern of correlation strengths oscillating or propagating through the correlation node graph. For example, a simple harmonic field oscillation in emergent space (say an electromagnetic wave) would, in the correlation graph, correspond to a wave-like modulation of 𝐾 values along some chain or region of the network. Each correlation node might carry a small oscillation in its state that is synchronized with its neighbors through their mutual correlations, effectively transmitting a wave. The projection map Π interprets these synchronized correlation oscillations as a field excitation in 𝓜. In the projection shadow picture, one might illustrate a field mode as a ripple or color gradient moving across Fig. 2, signifying how a disturbance travels through the emergent manifold. Because the underlying substrate is discrete (a network of Ж’s), these field modes are fundamentally granular at the Planck scale, but as θ projects a large number of correlation nodes into collective emergent coordinates, the field appears smooth at macroscopic scales. Notably, the correlation kernel 𝐾 sets the propagation properties of these modes: if correlations propagate or update through 𝒦 at a finite rate (limited by some fundamental speed c in the network), then field signals in 𝓜 will likewise have a finite propagation speed. In fact, the usual speed of light in emergent spacetime can be identified with this correlation propagation rate c, since no emergent signal can outrun the fundamental spread of correlation influences in the underlying graph. Thus, what we consider as local fields and their dynamics are emergent manifestations of correlation dynamics in 𝒦, mediated by Λ and filtered through Π. 
- Curvature and Gravity: The geometric curvature of 𝓜, which in general relativity is tied to gravity, emerges here from inhomogeneities or biases in the correlation structure. If the correlation kernel 𝐾 is uniform and translation-invariant across 𝒦, the projection will yield a flat emergent space with no preferred direction or curvature. However, any systematic variation in correlation connectivity—say a region where correlations are systematically stronger or weaker or fall off in a certain pattern—produces an emergent curvature in 𝓜. For instance, if a cluster of correlation nodes becomes more tightly interlinked (higher 𝐾) compared to elsewhere, the projection shadow will condense more points of 𝓜 in that region, representing a mass or energy concentration. The result is that nearby emergent points (test particles in 𝓜) will see their geodesics (straight-line paths in the emergent sense) bend toward that region, just as they would in a gravitational field near a mass. In the correlation graph, one could identify this as a sort of “entanglement well” or a dense subgraph that biases how other nodes connect through it. In emergent terms, that bias is gravity. Curved lines in the projection shadow (Fig. 2) illustrate how 
originally straight propagation (in a uniformly correlated network) becomes deflected in regions where 𝐾 is uneven. Notably, this approach provides a quantum-origin explanation for curvature: spacetime geometry isn’t a separate classical entity but a statistical outcome of underlying quantum correlations. Even the cosmological curvature (dark energy) can be framed this way: a slight bias in correlation distribution across the entire network (for example, a small uniform entanglement across vast distances) would appear as a tiny curvature term spread throughout 𝓜 (akin to a cosmological constant). In summary, the hills and valleys of spacetime—its curvature—are the direct shadows of peaks and troughs in the correlation landscape of 𝒦. (Note: The correlation-graph and projection-shadow metaphors have now served their pedagogical purpose. Subsequent sections use these terms as compact references to the formally defined structures; the reader may safely treat "shadow" as shorthand for "emergent representation under projection Π.") 
Through these graphical and conceptual lenses, we see that what we call “quantum mechanics” and “general relativity” in 𝓜 might both be different faces of the same underlying correlation structure in 𝒦. Entanglement (quantum aspect) and curvature (geometric aspect) emerge together, rooted in 𝐾, and mediated into our experience by the projection map. 
Pregeometric Dynamics vs Emergent Observables (Summary) 
Pregeometric dynamics refer to the fundamental processes occurring in the constraint manifold 𝒦, whereas emergent observables are the resultant phenomena that manifest in 𝓜 for observers like us. It is crucial to distinguish these layers of description. In 𝒦, correlation nodes Ж continually update their states and correlations according to the basic rules of the theory. These updates occur in an internal sequence governed by an internal time parameter τ_int. We can think of τ_int as the “clock of 𝒦” – for example, it might increment in discrete steps if the underlying dynamics are algorithmic, or flow continuously if 𝒦 has a continuous process. Importantly, τ_int is not directly the time we observe in the laboratory; it is a more primitive temporal ordering that drives changes in the correlation network. The projection map Π, together with mediator Λ, translates this sequence of internal updates into the familiar flow of time in 𝓜. In other words, what an emergent observer experiences as time progression (measured by clocks, decay processes, etc. in spacetime) is a reflection of the cumulative effect of many τ_int steps. For example, one might posit that a certain large number of ticks of τ_int correspond to one second of emergent time (with the exact conversion set by how fast processes in 𝒦 must run to emulate physics in 𝓜). In a well-behaved emergent universe, this correspondence would be regular and stable, giving a uniform arrow of time in 𝓜 aligned with increasing τ_int. 
Simpler phrasing: The ‘internal update interval’ is the smallest unit of change in the pregeometric world—like a single tick of a cosmic clock that runs beneath spacetime. Each tick, the correlation network updates slightly. Many such ticks accumulate to produce one second of the time we experience. The ratio (ticks per second) can vary depending on local conditions, which is how time dilation emerges. 
Intuitive picture: Imagine a computer simulation. The simulation has its own ‘game time’ (seconds in the game world), but the processor has ‘clock cycles’ that execute the computation. Internal time τ_int is like processor cycles—the fundamental ticks driving change in 𝒦. Emergent time (what clocks measure) is like game time: it emerges from many τ_int steps, with the conversion rate depending on local conditions. 
Within 𝒦, causality and propagation of effects are governed by the correlation links and a finite propagation rate c for correlation changes (signals). No update or influence can spread through the correlation node network faster than this rate. When projected to 𝓜, this implies an emergent causal structure that mirrors relativistic causality: the constant c acts as the maximum signal speed in spacetime (analogous to the speed of light). This is a striking result of the theory – a key emergent observable (the invariant speed of light and the causal light-cone structure of spacetime) is directly inherited from a pregeometric limit on correlation propagation. Thus, relativity is not an independent postulate but a consequence of the network dynamics in 𝒦. 
Summarizing the relationship between the layers: the pregeometric level (𝒦) is the hidden engine of reality, complete with its own elements (Ж), interactions (via 𝐾), and timestep (τ_int). It operates beyond direct observation, but its state and evolution are projected into the emergent level (𝓜) where familiar physics unfolds. Emergent observables – positions, motions, particles, fields, entanglement patterns, curvature of spacetime – are all shadows cast by the underlying correlation state. A static configuration in 𝒦 would correspond to a timeless, unchanging 𝓜, whereas dynamic evolution in 𝒦 (τ_int ticking forward, correlations updating) produces the flow of time and change in 𝓜. Notably, while an observer in 𝓜 sees objects move and fields propagate, a theorist examining 𝒦 sees only changing correlation relationships among correlation nodes. The laws of physics in 𝓜 (whether quantum field interactions or gravitational dynamics) thus emerge from the rules of correlation evolution in 𝒦. This separation clarifies why we call 𝒦 pregeometric: concepts like distance, locality, or even particle identity are not fundamental there but are secondary, arising only after projection. 
In conclusion, Section III.B has outlined how the projection map Π, assisted by mediator Λ, carries the tapestry of correlations in 𝒦 into the emergent stage of 𝓜, giving rise to geometry, fields, and quantum phenomena. The correlation kernel 𝐾 was highlighted as the determinant of emergent geometry, effectively encoding the spacetime metric in a pre-spacetime form. The parameter θ was introduced to describe how different 
“orientations” of the projection can yield different emergent worlds from the same underlying reality, hinting at a rich diversity of phases or solutions within the theory. Through conceptual figures (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2) we related the abstract network of correlation node correlations to visual metaphors in emergent space, illustrating the origin of entanglement, field modes, and curvature from the correlation structure. Finally, we underscored the distinction between the invisible, yet dynamical, pregeometric processes in 𝒦 – ticking in units of τ_int and bound by correlation propagation at speed c – and the observable, emergent phenomena in 𝓜, which include our experience of time, objects, and forces. This dichotomy between 𝒦 and 𝓜, and the precise manner in which one produces the other, lies at the heart of Projective Correlation Theory, setting the stage for further mathematical formulation and empirical interpretation in subsequent. 
III.C. Formal Projection Dynamics in PCT 
Correlation Kernel on the Constraint Manifold 
We introduce a positive correlation kernel K: 𝒦 × 𝒦 → ℝ₊ on the constraint manifold 𝒦. For any two configurations x, y ∈ 𝒦, the value K(x, y) defines a non-negative weight representing their compatibility or mutual consistency. Higher K(x, y) means configurations x and y strongly satisfy the imposed constraints together, whereas K approaching 0 indicates incompatibility. 
The kernel K is typically symmetric (K(x, y) = K(y, x)) and can be normalized or scaled as needed. Conceptually, K acts as a metric of correlation on C: it assigns each pair of constraint-states a weight that will influence how the theory counts and connects those states. This kernel underpins all quantitative measures in PCT – it gauges which pregeometric configurations "go together" and thus which clusters of C will project into stable structures. 
Projection Map and Emergent Geometry 
A projection map Π: C → M is defined to carry each constrained configuration x in C to a point Π(x) in the emergent manifold M of physical states. Intuitively, Π "forgets" the hidden degrees of freedom in x and retains only the collective, emergent coordinates (the macroscopic observables or geometric variables). 
The projection angle θ parameterizes how this map is oriented relative to C. Different values of θ correspond to projecting along different "directions" in the high-dimensional constraint space, thereby altering how distances and structures in C are squashed or stretched onto M. For example, consider C as a high-dimensional object – projecting it at angle θ₁ versus θ₂ onto a lower-dimensional subspace M can yield distinct images (akin to casting different shadows of a complex shape). 
In PCT, these projection angles θ influence the emergent geometry on M: clusters of configurations in C that are viewed at one angle may appear contiguous (forming a local patch of geometry), while at another angle they might disperse or overlap differently. Formally, if TₓC denotes the tangent space at x ∈ C, and T_Π(x)M the tangent at its image, one can define θ(x) as the angle between TₓC and the pullback of TM in C. 
A small θ means Π is "nearly orthogonal" to C (minimally distorting distances), leading to an emergent M geometry that closely preserves the intrinsic correlations of C. A larger θ skews the projection, potentially inducing curvature or identifying distant C-states as nearby points in M. Thus, by adjusting θ, one can model how different effective spacetimes or solution manifolds emerge from the same underlying constraint space. 
Concrete example: Consider a spin network with fixed connectivity. Projecting at angle θ₁ might yield an emergent space where the effective speed of light is c and gravity is weak. Projecting the same network at angle θ₂ could yield a space where light travels at 0.9c and gravity is stronger—different ‘laws of physics’ from the same underlying structure. This is analogous to how a wireframe cube, when rotated, can cast shadows that look like a square, a hexagon, or a complex polygon—same object, different apparent geometries. In PCT, the ‘laws of physics’ we observe (the values of c, G, α) may partly reflect which projection angle our universe happens to occupy. 
Free Energy and Constraint Population 
Let S: 𝒦 → ℝ be an entropy functional defined on the constraint manifold, and ∇S its gradient with respect to the coordinates on 𝒦. The constraint population ρ_𝒦(x) represents the density (or weight) of configurations at point x in 𝒦 – for instance, ρ_𝒦 could be proportional to the local volume of microstates or the likelihood of configuration x being realized. 
We postulate that physical dynamics on 𝒦 minimize an effective Constraint Free Energy ℱ. Previous formulations relied on pure entropy maximization, which implies disorder. However, to account for the system's tendency to "cool" into highly correlated structures, we define the Free Energy functional on the constraint manifold. The natural motion in 𝒦 follows the gradient of free energy: systems seek high correlation (low potential energy) while maintaining some spread (high entropy). Mathematically, we can express an intrinsic evolution equation on 𝒦: dx/dτ = -D ∇ℱ(x), where ℱ[u] = U_corr[u] - τ_int S_config[u] 
for some positive "diffusivity" constant D that sets the scale of motion in configuration space. In this equation, U_corr represents the "binding potential" (the system seeks high compatibility) while S_config is the configuration entropy. The effective "temperature" τ_int balances these terms. This equation indicates that over an intrinsic time increment dτ, the configuration x shifts to minimize the free energy ℱ. The system "cools" (orders itself) by minimizing U_corr (finding high correlations), but maintains fluctuations due to the entropic term, preventing total collapse to a single point. At equilibrium (or a steady state of the projection dynamics), ∇∇ℱ = 0, meaning no net free energy gradient and thus a balance of correlation potential and entropic terms has been reached. 
Connectivity Constraints and Emergent c 
Importantly, there is no intrinsic "speed of light" in 𝒦 because there is no metric background. Instead, PCT enforces a Connectivity Constraint: information can only propagate between hyperstates that are correlation-neighbors. We define the Pregeometric Hop Distance d_G(u,v) as the minimum number of correlation links required to connect u and v. The fundamental causal bound is expressed as a neighbor-update constraint: in each interval τ_int of intrinsic time, a state can only influence states within k-degrees of separation per internal tick. Formally: 
Δd_G / Δτ_int ≤ 1 (hop per tick) 
This topological constraint implies that influence cannot "teleport" across the correlation graph. When projected onto the emergent manifold M (which has geometry), this topological hop-limit manifests as a maximum signal velocity: c_emergent = Projected Distance / Internal Update Tick. Thus, the speed of light c is not a fundamental constant of the hyperverse, but the emergent shadow of the pregeometric connectivity bound. The system must evolve through intermediate states, preserving cause-effect consistency through the connectivity structure rather than through a primitive speed limit. 
In effect, the connectivity constraint bounds the rate of information transfer and reconfiguration in the pregeometric space, ensuring that even in the abstract C, there is an analog of light-cone causality. No physical observer in M can see a discontinuous leap in the underlying constraints beyond this bound, preserving causeeffect consistency. Together with the free energy gradient principle, these causal bounds yield a constrained gradient flow on C: the system strives to minimize ℱ (explore compatible configurations with appropriate correlation-entropy balance) but can only do so within the incremental limits set by the connectivity constraint. 
Projection Volumes and the Born Rule 
A striking implication of the PCT framework is that it offers a geometric route to the Born rule of quantum mechanics. In conventional terms, the Born rule [4] states that the probability of an outcome is the squared amplitude of the system's wavefunction for that outcome. In PCT, consider the set of all configurations in 𝒦 that project to a given macroscopic outcome m ∈ 𝓜. Denote this set (the "fiber" over m) as: 
F(m) = {x ∈ 𝒦 | Π(x) = m} 
If we assume a uniform a priori weighting of configurations or, more generally, weight each configuration x by the density ρ_𝒦(x), then the total compatibility volume associated with outcome m is proportional to the measure of F(m): 
W(m) = ∫_F(m) ρ_𝒦(x) dV_𝒦 
where dV_𝒦 is the volume element on 𝒦. This weight W(m) represents the aggregated correlation for all microstates yielding m. The projection postulate in PCT is that the probability of observing m is determined by this total weight, relative to the weights of all other outcomes. That is: 
P(m) = W(m) / Σ_m' W(m') 
In essence, outcomes that can be realized by many compatible configurations (large F(m)) are more probable than those with fewer pre-image states. Crucially, if ρ_𝒦 is roughly constant or if we absorb it into the volume form, then W(m) is essentially the "volume" (number of consistent micro-configurations) mapping to m. This volumecounting yields a quadratic probability law reminiscent of the Born rule. 
We can make this connection explicit by defining a projection amplitude ψ(m) as proportional to the square root of W(m). Then: |ψ(m)|² ∝ W(m) and 
P(m) = |ψ(m)|² / Σ_m' |ψ(m')|² 
which is exactly the Born rule interpretation of |ψ|². In other words, the probability emerges as the square of an amplitude that is itself constructed from counting (or summing over) microstates in the pregeometric constraint space. This derivation treats the Born rule not as a mysterious axiom, but as a statistical consequence of geometric projection: it arises from the measure-theoretic fact that volumes (or norms) scale quadratically with linear dimensions. 
If the correlation kernel K is positive-definite, one can go further and interpret K as an inner product on an induced Hilbert space H. By Mercer's theorem [3], there exists a feature map Φ: C → H such that K(x, y) = ⟨Φ(x)|Φ(y)⟩ in H. In this Hilbert-space picture, each configuration x corresponds to a vector |x⟩ = Φ(x), and an outcome m corresponds to a projector onto the subspace spanned by all |x⟩ with Π(x) = m. The total weight W(m) is then ⟨Ψ|Ψ⟩ for a "state vector" |Ψ⟩ = Σ_{x∈F(m)} |x⟩ combining all contributing configurations. The probability P(m) equals the squared norm of the normalized projection of the state onto the outcome subspace. Thus, PCT recovers the Born rule by interpreting probability as a normalized squared projection length in the high-dimensional space of correlations. 
Field Propagator Example (Klein–Gordon Scalar) 
To illustrate the formalism, we map a familiar physical law – the Klein–Gordon scalar field – into the PCT framework. The Klein–Gordon equation: 
(□ + μ²) φ(x) = 0 
describes a free relativistic scalar field (with □ the d'Alembertian and μ the mass parameter). Its Feynman propagator D_F(x,y) is the two-point correlation function giving the amplitude for the field to propagate from event y to event x. In fact, D_F satisfies the Green's function equation (□_x + μ²) D_F(x,y) = δ⁽⁴⁾(x - y), reflecting causality and field dynamics. 
Within PCT, consider an extended constraint manifold C that encompasses all possible field configurations φ(x) (for all spacetime points x) – essentially the field's configuration space. A particular configuration in C might assign a value to the field at every point (or, in a discrete approximation, a set of field amplitudes on a lattice). We now interpret the field's action (or Lagrangian) in terms of correlation weights on C. 
For two field configurations A, B ∈ C, define K(A, B) based on how "nearby" A is to B in field space and whether B can evolve from A under the Klein–Gordon dynamics. For instance, one convenient choice is to let: K(A, B) = exp(-ΔI[A→B] / Λ) 
where ΔI[A→B] is an effective action difference between configuration A and B, and Λ is a scaling constant (e.g., related to ℏ). If B is obtainable from A by a small physical evolution (meaning the field obeys the equation of motion along the path from A to B), then ΔI will be small and thus K(A, B) will be close to 1, signifying strong correlation. If B is dynamically far from A (requiring a large action change or not satisfying field equations), K will be exponentially suppressed. In the continuum limit, the highest contributions to correlation come from pairs of field configurations that differ only by on-shell fluctuations – i.e., those linked by actual solutions of the Klein– Gordon equation. 
Using this correlation kernel, we can derive the standard propagator as an emergent quantity. Imagine projecting C onto an event pair manifold M that labels two spacetime points (say x and y). The projection Π maps a full field configuration to the two field values (φ(x), φ(y)) observed at those points. 
Now, what is the correlation of the field's value at x with its value at y? In PCT, it is given by summing K over all configurations that project to specific values at x and y. Because K incorporates the field's action weighting, this sum over configurations is mathematically analogous to summing over all field histories connecting x and y – much like a path integral. 
Indeed, each configuration in the fiber F((x,y)) that has φ(x) = a, φ(y) = b contributes a weight ∝ exp(-I[φ]/Λ), and summing these yields an amplitude K_eff(x,y) for the field to have correlation between a at x and b at y. The maximum of this correlation occurs when a and b are related by the field's equation of motion. 
In effect, the projected correlation kernel K_eff(x,y) on the two-point manifold M reproduces the familiar propagator D_F(x,y). In the free-field case, this is just the Klein–Gordon propagator, which we know is a function Δ_F(x-y) solving (□ + μ²)Δ_F = δ. 
Thus, PCT can encode field dynamics: the causal structure and Green's functions of a quantum field appear as emergent correlators when the correlation kernel K on C is chosen in accordance with the field's action. This demonstrates that classical field propagation – and by extension, quantum propagation – can be seen as a projection of constraint correlations. 
The advantages of this viewpoint are profound: complicated propagators arise from simple rules of correlation on C (essentially energy–action minimization and summation over consistent field histories), and interactions or mass terms would just modify the form of K accordingly (e.g., including terms in ΔI for self-interactions or potential energy), yielding the correct interacting propagators in the emergent picture. 
Discrete Graph Toy Model 
To build intuition, we present a minimal toy model of projection dynamics using a small discrete graph. Consider three pregeometric basis states (nodes) labeled 1, 2, and 3, which represent fundamental micro-configurations in C. We specify a symmetric matrix of K-values (edge weights) between every pair of nodes, for example: 
- K(1,2) = 0.9 (strong correlation between states 1 and 2) 
- K(1,3) = 0.4 (moderate correlation between 1 and 3) 
- K(2,3) = 0.0 (state 2 and 3 are incompatible under the constraints) 
Each node can be thought of as a simple configuration (say, a particular assignment of some discrete degrees of freedom). A constraint in this model could be that not all states can occur at once – for instance, the system may realize at most two of these basis states simultaneously (this mimics a conservation or exclusivity constraint). The constraint manifold C here consists of all allowed combinations: {1,2}, {1,3} are allowed (two states present), whereas {2,3} is forbidden (K(2,3) = 0 indicates these cannot coexist), and {1,2,3} is also forbidden by the at-mosttwo rule. 
Now we examine a projection Π from C to a simpler emergent space M. Let M be one-dimensional for simplicity (imagine we want an emergent order or position). One reasonable projection is to map any configuration to the center-of-mass of its participating nodes along a line. Suppose we assign coordinate values to nodes 1, 2, 3 initially (for example, x₁ = 0, x₂ = 1, x₃ = 2 on a line). If Π projects a multi-node configuration to the average of their coordinates, then Π({1,2}) would land at 0.5, Π({1,3}) at 1.0, etc. 
However, because 1 and 2 are strongly correlated, we might choose a projection angle θ that effectively clusters them closer in M. By selecting θ such that nodes 1 and 2 overlap in the projection, we define an emergent geometry where those states are not distinguishable at the macroscopic level (they form a single effective point). Under this projection, the configuration {1,2} and {1} would both map to the same emergent point (since 2 falls on 1's location in M), whereas node 3 remains separate. 
The result is that M has two emergent points: one corresponding to the cluster {1,2} and another corresponding to state 3. Geometrically, the distance between 1 and 2 in M is nearly zero (reflecting K(1,2) ≈ 0.9), while the distance between the {1,2} cluster and 3 in M is larger (reflecting the weaker correlations 0.4 and 0 between 3 and the others). 
We can simulate entropy dynamics on this toy model. Start with an initial equal superposition of allowed configurations {1,2} and {1,3} (each with probability 0.5, say). The entropy S of this mixture (in an information sense) is log 2. However, the correlation weights bias the system toward {1,2} because that pair has a higher K and is more compatible. Over a few intrinsic time steps τ_int, the system will "cool" into the {1,2} configuration predominantly. 
Indeed, the entropy gradient S in configuration space points toward {1,2} (since making {1,2} more populated increases the compatibility-weighted count of states). After relaxation, the distribution might be, for example, P({1,2}) ≈ 0.95, P({1,3}) ≈ 0.05. The entropy S of this final distribution is lower (since the uncertainty is reduced), indicating that the system self-organized into a more correlated state – it "chose" the configuration that maximizes the total K-weight. This demonstrates how S drives the selection of high-correlation configurations. 
Throughout this process, the causal bound c ensured that the system didn't jump directly from {1,3} to {1,2} in one step if we consider them far in C; instead it might have transitioned via {1} alone or another intermediate, respecting an incremental update rule. 
Finally, consider the emergent prediction in M from this toy model: since {1,2} is the overwhelmingly favored microstate, the macroscopic projection Π will almost always yield the clustered outcome (the point representing 1&2 together). The alternative outcome (state 3 separated) is rare. In quantum terms, one could say the "wavefunction" has collapsed mostly onto the subspace spanned by {1,2}. 
This discrete example, albeit simple, captures the essence of PCT's projection dynamics: configurations carry correlation weights; the system evolves under entropy and causal rules to favor compatible configurations; and upon projection, the statistics of outcomes reflect the underlying correlation volumes. Even in this toy model, if we compute the Born probabilities for the two possible outcomes in M, we find P(cluster 1&2) ≈ 0.95 and P(isolated 3) ≈ 0.05, mirroring the weight ratio of configuration counts (and indeed proportional to the squared amplitude if one assigns an amplitude √0.95 to the dominant state). This agreement with a Born-rule-like distribution is not a coincidence but a direct consequence of how we constructed the model: by counting consistent constraint configurations (and their K weights) that lead to each outcome. 
Summary 
In Section III.C, we have established a rigorous mathematical foundation for projection dynamics within the PCT framework. We defined the correlation kernel K on the constraint manifold 𝒦 to quantify configuration compatibility, and the projection map Π: 𝒦 → 𝓜 (with angle θ) to understand how emergent geometries can arise from different "views" of 𝒦. 
We incorporated key dynamical elements – the entropy gradient ∇S and constraint population ρ_𝒦 – which drive systems toward higher compatibility states, all the while constrained by causal update limits (c, τ_int). We showed how a fundamental quantum rule (the Born rule) might emerge from counting projection volumes in 𝒦, and we linked a classical field's propagator to correlation weights to demonstrate PCT's ability to recover known physics. 
A finite graph example was provided to illustrate these concepts in a simplified setting. Altogether, these formal developments elevate the theoretical maturity of PCT: the model now has concrete equations and mechanisms that make quantitative predictions, guiding it beyond a conceptual Level 5.5 towards a testable, predictive framework. The next sections will build on this foundation to explore specific solutions and phenomenology predicted by PCT's formalism. 
 
III.D Rigorous Mathematical Foundations and Continuum Limit 
This section provides one possible rigorous mathematical underpinning for the constructs introduced in Sections 
II–III. A deliberate interpretive openness has been maintained in earlier sections: terms like "correlation node," "constraint manifold," and "projection mediator" are not claimed to be uniquely defined physical entities but rather conceptual placeholders admitting multiple formal realizations. The definitions below represent one consistent mathematical instantiation; alternative formalizations (e.g., category-theoretic, algebraic, or information-geometric) may capture the same physical content. This pluralism is intentional—PCT identifies structural relationships and predictions that should be robust across different mathematical framings. 
III.D.1 Axiomatic Definition of the Constraint Manifold. The constraint manifold 𝒦 is not merely a "set of states" but a measure space with additional structure.

Definition III.D.1 (Constraint manifold; type signature).
A constraint manifold is a quadruple (𝒦, Σ_𝒦, μ_𝒦, d_𝒦) where:
(i) 𝒦 is a set (the space of admissible pregeometric configurations);
(ii) Σ_𝒦 is a σ-algebra on 𝒦 (enabling measure-theoretic integration);
(iii) μ_𝒦 is a σ-finite measure on (𝒦, Σ_𝒦);
(iv) d_𝒦: 𝒦 × 𝒦 → [0,∞) is a metric (or pseudo-metric) inducing a topology τ_𝒦.
Here d_𝒦 is an auxiliary regularity structure (e.g., induced by graph adjacency or by a kernel-defined notion of neighborhood) and is not interpreted as an emergent spacetime distance. In the finite case (|𝒦| = N < ∞), μ_𝒦 reduces to counting measure and d_𝒦 is the graph-theoretic distance. In the continuum limit, (𝒦, τ_𝒦) becomes a Polish space (complete, separable, metrizable).

III.D.2 Axiomatic Definition of Correlation nodes. A "correlation node" is not a primitive object but a derived construct.

Definition III.D.2 (Correlation node; type signature).
A correlation node Ж is a probability measure π_Ж ∈ 𝒫(𝒦) satisfying the admissibility condition:
  supp(π_Ж) ⊆ 𝒦_adm
where 𝒦_adm = {u ∈ 𝒦 : ρ_𝒦(u) > 0}.
The "state" of a correlation node is not a point u ∈ 𝒦 but the measure π_Ж over admissible configurations. This captures the PCT principle that no definite pregeometric configuration exists—only weighted possibilities. A "pure" correlation node corresponds to π_Ж = δ_u (Dirac measure); a "mixed" correlation node has broader support.

III.D.3 Axiomatic Definition of the Projection Structure. The projection mediator Λ and projection angle θ are rigorously defined as follows.

Definition III.D.3 (Projection structure; type signature).
A projection structure is a triple (Θ, ν_Θ, Π) where:
(i) Θ is a measurable space (the "parameter space" or "angle space");
(ii) ν_Θ is a probability measure on Θ (the "projection mediator" Λ specifies ν_Θ);
(iii) Π is a Markov kernel
  Π : 𝒦 × Θ → 𝒫(𝓜)
so that for each (u,θ), Π(·|u;θ) is a probability measure on the emergent manifold 𝓜.
The "projection angle" θ ∈ Θ parametrizes which projection rule is applied. The mediator Λ determines the distribution ν_Θ from which θ is sampled.

III.D.4 Kernel Smoothness and Topological Structure. The compatibility kernel K: 𝒦 × 𝒦 → ℝ₊ satisfies regularity conditions enabling differential calculus.

Definition III.D.4 (Admissible kernel; type signature).
A kernel K is a map
  K : 𝒦 × 𝒦 → ℝ_{d7d9}
and is admissible if:
(i) K is symmetric: K(u,v) = K(v,u);
(ii) K is positive semi-definite: Σᵢⱼ cᵢcⱼK(uᵢ,uⱼ) ≥ 0 for all finite sets {uᵢ} and reals {cᵢ};
(iii) K is continuous in the τ_𝒦 topology: for any ε > 0 and u₀, there exists δ > 0 such that d_𝒦(u,u₀) < δ implies |K(u,v) − K(u₀,v)| < ε uniformly in v;
(iv) K decays: K(u,v) → 0 as d_𝒦(u,v) → ∞.
These conditions ensure K defines a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) ℋ_K with inner product ⟨f,g⟩_K = Σᵢⱼ αᵢβⱼK(uᵢ,uⱼ) for f = Σᵢ αᵢK(·,uᵢ), g = Σⱼ βⱼK(·,uⱼ). The RKHS provides the smoothness structure for differential operators.
III.D.5 The Continuum Limit: Discrete to Continuous. The limiting procedure from discrete models to continuum physics is made explicit. Theorem 4 (Continuum Limit). Let {𝒦_N}_{N=1}^∞ be a sequence of finite constraint manifolds with |𝒦_N| = N, equipped with kernels K_N and measures μ_N = (1/N)Σᵤ δᵤ. Suppose: (a) The embeddings φ_N: 𝒦_N → 𝒦_∞ converge: d_H(φ_N(𝒦_N), 𝒦_∞) → 0 in Hausdorff metric; (b) The kernels converge: sup_{u,v} |K_N(φ_N⁻¹(u), φ_N⁻¹(v)) − K_∞(u,v)| → 0; (c) The measures converge weakly: μ_N ∘ φ_N⁻¹ ⇀ μ_∞. Then the induced correlator G₂^{(N)}(x,y) → G₂^{(∞)}(x,y) uniformly on compact subsets of 𝓜 × 𝓜, and the effective generator L_ρ^{(N)} → L_ρ^{(∞)} in the strong resolvent sense. 
Proof sketch. The correlator G₂^{(N)}(x,y) = (1/Z_N)Σᵤ,ᵥ K_N(u,v)ρ_N(u)ρ_N(v)Π(x|u)Π(y|v) is a Riemann sum approximation to G₂^{(∞)}(x,y) = (1/Z_∞)∫∫ K_∞(u,v)ρ_∞(u)ρ_∞(v)Π(x|u)Π(y|v)dμ_∞(u)dμ_∞(v). Conditions (a)– (c) ensure the sum converges to the integral. The generator convergence follows from the Trotter–Kato theorem applied to the heat semigroups exp(−tL_ρ^{(N)}). ∎ 

III.D.5a UV/continuum-limit subsection (explicit cutoff, limit, and renormalization prescription).
This subsection makes the UV/continuum-limit statement operational: it defines (i) the UV control parameter (cutoff or refinement level), (ii) the limit taken, (iii) which quantities are allowed to run with the regulator, and (iv) what “UV-complete” means *in this paper*.

UV control parameter (two equivalent languages).
• Cutoff language: a UV scale Λ (energy) or a short-distance cutoff a ∼ Λ^{-1}.
• Discrete/refinement language: a refinement level N (e.g., number of nodes N_𝒦 in a discrete 𝒦_N sequence), with an associated lattice spacing a_N → 0 as N → ∞.

Limit taken.
• UV/continuum limit is defined as Λ → ∞ (equivalently a → 0) or, in discrete realizations, as N → ∞ with a_N → 0.
• In practical numerics (Sections V.B and V.J), this is implemented as N_𝒦 → ∞ (and, where relevant, N_𝓜 → ∞) together with an explicit scaling prescription for resolution parameters so that the extracted θ-invariant observables have a nontrivial limit (cf. V.J.1).

Renormalization prescription (what is allowed to run).
To keep the microclass statement non-vacuous, we separate:
(A) Renormalized (finite) parameters: a finite set {g_i^R(μ)} at a chosen reference scale μ (these are the only “free numbers” permitted after renormalization).
(B) Bare/regulated quantities that are allowed to depend on the cutoff/refinement:
• kernel family parameters (e.g., η = η(Λ) or η_N),
• projection resolution/width parameters (e.g., σ_Π = σ_Π(Λ) or σ_Π,N),
• normalization factors (e.g., Z = Z(Λ)) needed to keep induced correlators finite.
The renormalization condition is: choose the running of these bare quantities so that a stated finite set of θ-invariant observables at a reference scale μ take prescribed (finite) values and remain stable under further increases of Λ (or N).

Operational criterion for “UV-complete” *in this paper* (scoped).
We call the framework “UV-complete (in the paper’s restricted sense)” if there exists:
(i) a scaling/renormalization scheme for the allowed bare quantities (K_Λ, Π_Λ, ρ_𝒦,Λ, ν_{Θ,Λ}) with a finite set of renormalized parameters {g_i^R(μ)};
(ii) a UV window Λ ≥ Λ_0 (equivalently N ≥ N_0) on which a declared set of θ-invariant observables 𝒪_j(Λ) are regulator-independent up to a stated tolerance;
(iii) convergence of those observables as Λ → ∞ (or N → ∞):
  lim_{Λ→∞} 𝒪_j(Λ) exists and is finite for all j in the declared set.

Declared “UV-facing observable set” for v52 (minimum).
Unless explicitly overridden in a given module, the minimal UV-facing set is:
• d_s(ℓ) over a stated UV window of ℓ (including the existence/location of any discontinuity ℓ*),
• the dimensionless discontinuity ratio κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H (when r_H is defined by the applicable regime gate),
• Δd_s (step size) when the discontinuity module is invoked.

Status note (v52). This manuscript specifies the continuum-limit scaling ansatz (V.J.1) and reports convergence behavior for the discontinuity module (V.J.2), but it does not yet provide a general renormalization proof for arbitrary observables or a fixed-point analysis; those would strengthen the UV claim beyond the scoped criterion above.

III.D.6 Metric Emergence and Hawking-Scaling Proxy from Correlation Structure. The metric tensor is not assumed but derived from the correlation structure, and (once a horizon module is defined) the same boundary data yield a Hawking-scaling (thermality/leakage) proxy. Theorem 5 (Geometry + Hawking-Scaling Proxy). Let G₂(x,y) be the induced correlator with G₂(x,x) > 0 and G₂(x,y) → 0 as |x−y| → ∞. Define the correlation distance d_corr(x,y) := −ln[G₂(x,y)/√(G₂(x,x)G₂(y,y))]. If G₂ is C² in a neighborhood of the diagonal, then g^{(E)}_μν(x) := (1/2)∂²d_corr²(x,y)/∂y^μ∂y^ν|_{y=x} defines a positive semidefinite symmetric 2-tensor. If det(g^{(E)}_μν) > 0, this is a Riemannian metric.

Assumptions list (explicit; for audit).
(A5.1) Domain: statement applies only on a stated patch Ω ⊂ 𝓜 and for displacements |dx| within a stated scale window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁] where the required regularity holds.
(A5.2) Normalization/positivity: G₂(x,x)>0 so Ĝ₂ and d_corr are well-defined.
(A5.3) Regularity: G₂ is at least C² in a neighborhood of the diagonal on Ω (or sufficient for the quadratic expansion used).
(A5.4) (For Hawking-scaling proxy) Operational horizon definition: a boundary ∂B is defined in the stated scheme (e.g., via ε_out-thresholded V_{Π,out}→0), and BC2 holds on the relevant exterior region so “outward” is meaningful.
(A5.5) (For Hawking-scaling proxy) Boundary differentiability: ρ̄ admits an outward normal derivative ∂ρ̄/∂n on ∂B in the same scheme/discretization used to define ∂B.

Moreover, suppose a horizon boundary ∂B is defined operationally (e.g., via collapse of outward-compatible projection volume V_Π,out → 0) and that the projected environment field ρ̄ admits a well-defined outward normal derivative at ∂B. Define the normalized boundary steepness functional G(x) := |∂ρ̄/∂n|(x)/ρ̄_crit on x ∈ ∂B and its boundary average Ḡ. Then the PCT surface-gravity proxy κ_PCT := c·Ḡ yields a Hawking-scaling temperature proxy T_H := (ħ/(2πk_B))κ_PCT, with the net outward leakage amplitude controlled separately by V_Π,out.

Proof. Expand d_corr²(x,x+δy) = −2ln[G₂(x,x+δy)/G₂(x,x)] + O(δy⁴). For small δy, G₂(x,x+δy) = G₂(x,x)[1 + ∂_μ ln G₂ δy^μ + (1/2)∂_μ∂_ν ln G₂ δy^μδy^ν + O(δy³)]. Thus d_corr²(x,x+δy) = −∂_μ∂_ν ln G₂(x,y)|_{y=x} δy^μδy^ν + O(δy³). Define g^{(E)}_μν(x) := −∂_μ∂_ν ln G₂(x,y)|_{y=x}. Symmetry is immediate; positive semi-definiteness follows from G₂ being a positive-definite kernel (Mercer's theorem [3]). The Hawking-scaling proxy statement follows by definition once ∂B and the boundary functional G(x) are specified (as developed explicitly in Section IV.D.5). ∎ 
Remark (Signature Emergence). Theorem 5 derives a Riemannian (positive semi-definite) metric from the spatial correlation structure. The Lorentzian signature required for causality is represented by a separate (derived) Lorentzian proxy metric whose null structure matches the characteristic cones of the principal symbol A^μν of the correlation transport operator L_ρ (Section IV.B). In this manuscript we use the mostly-plus convention (−,+,+,+). Specifically: (i) Z_t controls timelike propagation (correlation update rate); (ii) Z_s controls spacelike propagation (spatial correlation decay). 

To avoid internal ambiguity, we distinguish:
• g^{(E)}_μν : the (Riemannian) correlator-distance metric reconstructed from d_corr (Theorem 5).
• g^{(L)}_μν : the (Lorentzian) cone-proxy metric defined so that its null cones match the characteristics of L_ρ.

Convention enforcement (no transfer without gates). Do not identify, substitute, or “transfer” statements between g^{(E)}_μν and g^{(L)}_μν unless an explicit scope gate is stated *in that subsection*, including: (i) which BC items (BC1–BC5) passed/failed, (ii) the region Ω ⊂ 𝓜 on which the statement is asserted, and (iii) the scale window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁] used for the diagnostics. (This prevents importing Lorentzian/GR interpretations into a regime where only correlator-distance geometry is meaningful, or vice versa.)

A consistent Lorentzian cone-proxy metric is then:
    g^{(L)}_μν := diag(−1/Z_t, 1/Z_s, 1/Z_s, 1/Z_s),
which has signature (−,+,+,+) whenever Z_t, Z_s > 0. Theorem 5 applies to the spatial/correlator sector (g^{(E)}_μν), while the Lorentzian cone-proxy metric g^{(L)}_μν encodes causal structure through the asymmetric treatment of temporal vs. spatial correlation dynamics in L_ρ. 
III.D.7 Deformation Functions from Metric Consistency. The functions Z_t(ρ̄) and Z_s(ρ̄) are not freely chosen but constrained by consistency requirements. Theorem 6 (Deformation Uniqueness). Let the principal symbol of L_ρ be A^{μν}(x) = diag(Z_t(ρ̄), −Z_s(ρ̄), −Z_s(ρ̄), −Z_s(ρ̄)) in static spherical coordinates. Require: (i) Hyperbolicity: Z_t, Z_s > 0 for ρ̄ < ρ̄_crit; (ii) Asymptotic flatness: Z_t, Z_s → 1 as ρ̄ → 0; (iii) Metric-consistency gauge: for the Lorentzian proxy metric convention used in this manuscript, g_tt = −1/Z_t and g_rr = 1/Z_s with g_tt g_rr = −1; (iv) Horizon condition: Z_s/Z_t → 0 as ρ̄ → ρ̄_crit. Then Z_t(ρ̄) = 1/(1−f(ρ̄)) and Z_s(ρ̄) = 1−f(ρ̄) for some monotonic f: [0,ρ̄_crit] → [0,1] with f(0) = 0, f(ρ̄_crit) = 1. 

Assumptions list (explicit; for audit).
(A6.1) Domain: the statement is asserted only in a static, isotropic (spherically symmetric) proxy setting where the diagonal principal-symbol parametrization is appropriate.
(A6.2) Admissible exterior: BC2-style hyperbolicity holds on the region Ω where the causal/proxy metric interpretation is used (Z_t>0, Z_s>0).
(A6.3) Proxy-metric convention: the “metric-consistency” condition g_tt g_rr = −1 is a *chosen proxy convention/locking* (not a derived field equation) and must be treated as such whenever Theorem 6 is invoked.
(A6.4) Horizon condition is interpreted in the ε-regularized operational sense used elsewhere (i.e., Z_s/Z_t becomes arbitrarily small as ρ̄ approaches its critical threshold in the stated scheme).
Proof. Condition (iii) implies g_tt g_rr = −(1/(Z_t Z_s)) = −1, hence Z_t Z_s = 1. Combined with (iv): as ρ̄ → ρ̄_crit, Z_s → 0 forces Z_t → ∞. 
Parametrize Z_s = 1 − f(ρ̄); then Z_t = 1/(1−f(ρ̄)). Condition (ii) requires f(0) = 0. Condition (iv) requires f(ρ̄_crit) = 1. Monotonicity of f follows from physical requirement that gravity strengthens with increasing ρ̄. ∎ 
III.D.8 Summary: From Postulates to Derivations. The constructs introduced informally in Section II now have rigorous status: | Informal term | Rigorous definition | | Constraint manifold 𝒦 | Measure space (𝒦, Σ_𝒦, μ_𝒦) with metric d_𝒦 | | Correlation node Ж | Probability measure π_Ж ∈ 𝒫(𝒦) | | Projection mediator Λ | Probability measure ν_Θ on parameter space | | Projection angle θ | Element of measurable space Θ | | Kernel K | RKHSgenerating symmetric positive kernel | | Emergent metric g_μν | Derived from ∂²ln G₂ (Theorem 5) | | Deformation Z_t, Z_s | Constrained by metric consistency (Theorem 6) |. The continuum limit (Theorem 4) provides the bridge from discrete models to differential geometry. These foundations ensure PCT is not merely heuristic but mathematically well-defined. 
III.E Microclass Axioms and Conditional Theorems 
To make PCT’s predictions robust and non-optional, we define a minimal “microclass” of models satisfying specific axioms. All subsequent derivations are conditional on membership in this class. 
Definition (PCT Microclass). A model (𝒦, K, Π, Λ) belongs to the PCT microclass 𝒨 if it satisfies axioms (M1)–(M5): 
(M1) Kernel Regularity: K is symmetric, positive semi-definite, continuous, and decays at large distances. 
(M2) Projection Consistency: Π is a normalized Markov kernel from 𝒦 × Θ to 𝓜. 
(M3) Mediator Normalization: The measure induced by Λ on Θ is normalized. 
(M4) Correlation-Distance Compatibility: The induced correlator G₂ defines a valid metric d_corr on 𝓜. 
(M5) Spectral Convergence: The spectral dimension d_s(ℓ) converges to a finite IR limit. 
Theorem 7 (Conditional Geometry Emergence). If (𝒦, K, Π, Λ) ∈ 𝒨, then: (a) g^{(E)}_μν := −∂_μ∂_ν ln G₂ is well-defined and positive semi-definite; (b) If det(g^{(E)}) > 0, (𝓜, g^{(E)}) is Riemannian; (c) D_eff equals the topological dimension. 
Proof sketch. (a) follows from Theorem 5: membership in 𝒨 guarantees K is positive semi-definite (M1) and Π satisfies regularity (M2), ensuring G₂ is C² near the diagonal. (b) The positivity condition det(g) > 0 is equivalent to non-degeneracy of the kernel restriction to any local patch; M3 (compatibility) ensures sufficient correlations exist to span all directions. (c) Spectral convergence (M5) implies d_s(σ) → D_eff as σ → ∞, with D_eff determined by the large-scale return probability scaling P(σ) ∼ σ^{−D_eff/2}. ∎ 
Theorem 8 (Conditional Horizon Formation). If (𝒦, K, Π, Λ) ∈ 𝒨 and Z_s → 0 at ρ̄_crit, then horizons form with Schwarzschild geometry to leading order. 
Proof sketch. Z_s → 0 implies the spatial correlation propagator diverges: g_rr ∝ 1/Z_s → ∞. This is the signature of a coordinate singularity at fixed r. With the calibration f(ρ̄) = r_s/r (Section V.D), the condition Z_s(ρ̄_crit) = 0 occurs at r = r_s = 2M, recovering the Schwarzschild horizon. The leading-order metric ds² = −(1−r_s/r)dt² + (1−r_s/r)^{−1}dr² + r²dΩ² follows from the deformation ansatz Z_s = 1−f, Z_t = 1/(1−f) with f = r_s/r (Proposition 2). ∎ 
These conditional theorems make PCT’s claims precise: we assert that if nature belongs to 𝒨, specific phenomena follow necessarily. 
Section IV. EMERGENCE AND CORRESPONDENCE 
 
Section III established the formal primitives of Projective Correlation Theory (PCT): a constraint manifold 𝒦 equipped with a compatibility kernel K and constraint population ρ_𝒦, together with a stochastic projection Π(x|u;θ) into an emergent manifold 𝓜. From these ingredients, Section III defined induced correlation functions on 𝓜 and an effective generator L_ρ whose principal symbol determines emergent causal propagation. The purpose of Section IV is to translate that formal structure into physically interpretable content and to establish correspondence with the familiar language of geometry, fields, and gravitation. 
The guiding principle of this section is that “spacetime structure” is not assumed but reconstructed. In PCT, localisation, distance, dimensionality, and causal cones are derived from how projected correlations behave under the global compatibility constraints encoded by (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦) and mediated by Π. Accordingly, Section IV develops three linked correspondences. First, it shows how an effective geometric description on 𝓜 can be reconstructed directly from induced correlators, yielding a correlation-defined distance and a local metric field g_μν as an emergent summary. Second, it specifies how microcausality and propagation bounds arise from the principal symbol of L_ρ, fixing an effective causal structure without presupposing a fundamental spacetime metric. Third, it interprets gravitational phenomena as environment-dependent deformation of maintainable correlations, expressed as a deformation of the principal symbol through the projected constraint environment ρ̄(x;θ). This provides a route to horizons and black-hole phenomenology as threshold behaviour in the space of admissible projections rather than as a fundamental singular geometry. 
Section IV is also a correspondence section in the methodological sense. The framework does not claim novelty by replacing established predictions of general relativity or quantum field theory in regimes where they are already confirmed. Instead, it aims to reproduce the relevant limiting structures (locality, hyperbolic propagation, effective low-dimensional manifold behaviour, and weak-field gravitational scaling) while providing a deeper explanation of why those structures arise at all. Where multiple emergent behaviours are possible, admissibility is constrained by stability requirements: persistent localisation, consistent causal update rules, and robust record formation. These criteria function as selection principles on K, Π, and the induced operator family L_ρ, narrowing the space of viable realisations. 
Section IV.A begins by constructing an explicit reconstruction of geometry from correlation structure, including distance, local metric extraction, and dimensional diagnostics. This supplies the interpretive bridge required for subsequent subsections on causal propagation, gravity as compatibility deformation, and black-hole horizons as projection constraints. 
Section preview: We will show that a well-defined metric (the mathematical object encoding distances and angles) can be extracted from correlation data alone. The key result: the formula g_μν = −∂μ∂ν ln G₂ gives a metric tensor directly from the two-point correlator. This means geometry is not put in by hand—it emerges from quantum correlations. 
IV.A Emergent Geometry from Correlators 
Scope gate (BC reporting). Unless explicitly stated otherwise in a subsection, any GR/QFT-language interpretation in Section IV assumes the relevant BC items (BC1–BC5) are evaluated and reported on a stated region Ω ⊂ 𝓜 and scale window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁].

This subsection develops an explicit reconstruction of emergent geometry on 𝓜 directly from the induced two-point function G₂(x,y;θ). The goal is twofold. First, it defines a correlation-based notion of distance and a local (correlator-distance) metric field g^{(E)}_μν(x) without assuming any fundamental spacetime geometry. Second, it introduces quantitative diagnostics—spectral dimension and manifold-likeness criteria—that determine whether a given (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦, Π) realisation yields a stable low-dimensional continuum description. 

IV.A.0 Pregeometry → geometry reconstruction map (existence, uniqueness, equivalence classes)
This paper treats “geometry” as an emergent data structure reconstructed from pregeometric objects rather than as an input. Concretely, we take the microscopic objects to be:
• a constraint space 𝒦 with population ρ_𝒦,
• a compatibility/correlation kernel K on 𝒦,
• a projection structure (Θ, ν_Θ, Π), with Π(·|u;θ) a Markov kernel and ν_Θ the mediator.

Reconstruction map (definition).
Define the (regime-gated) reconstruction map
  \mathcal{R}: (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦, Π, ν_Θ; \Omega,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) \longmapsto \big(d_\mathrm{corr}|_{\Omega},\ g^{(E)}_{\mu\nu}|_{\Omega},\ A^{\mu\nu}|_{\Omega}\big),
where:
(i) d_corr and g^{(E)}_{\mu\nu} are reconstructed from the induced correlator G₂(x,y;θ) via (eqIV.A.1)–(eqIV.A.4) (correlator-distance geometry), and
(ii) A^{\mu\nu} is the principal-symbol tensor of the induced generator L_ρ (eqIV.A.5, IV.B), supplying causal/connection-relevant information (cone/transport geometry).
If desired, an effective connection \Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\nu} can then be defined on Ω by the Levi-Civita connection of the reconstructed g^{(E)}_{\mu\nu} when the reconstruction is smooth enough; otherwise one works with the metric/distance data and the principal-symbol/characteristic structure directly.

Existence conditions (when \mathcal{R} is defined).
The map \mathcal{R} is only asserted to exist on regions Ω and scale windows [ℓ₀,ℓ₁] where the operational gates pass:
• BC1 (manifold-likeness): quadratic residual and path-additivity diagnostics hold at scales up to ℓ₁, so that a local metric reconstruction is meaningful.
• BC2 (causal admissibility): Z_t>0 and Z_s>0 on Ω (equivalently, hyperbolicity of the principal symbol), so that A^{\mu\nu} defines consistent characteristic cones.
• Regularity assumptions used in theorems: e.g., G₂ is C² near the diagonal (Theorem 5) for metric extraction; and the required spectral/semigroup properties hold for defining Tr[e^{−ℓ² L_ρ}] and d_s(ℓ).

Uniqueness conditions (when two micro-descriptions yield the same geometry).
Because θ is declared gauge (V.S), the natural uniqueness statement is “unique up to gauge and observational equivalence.” Concretely, on a fixed (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) we treat the reconstruction as unique when:
• different θ choices inside the admissible class yield isometric reconstructions on Ω (equivalent up to diffeomorphism/relabeling), and
• the extracted θ-invariant observables (e.g., d_s(ℓ), κ, curvature scalars when defined, horizon indicators) agree within the stated tolerances.

Non-uniqueness classes (equivalence relations).
If reconstruction is not unique, we make the non-uniqueness explicit by grouping micro-descriptions into equivalence classes under the following relations:
• θ-gauge / diffeomorphism equivalence: (Π,θ) \sim (Π',θ') if their reconstructions are related by a diffeomorphism of Ω and agree on θ-invariant observables (V.S).
• Conformal/pseudometric equivalence (limited): g \sim \omega^2 g on Ω when only causal-cone structure is used (null cones), or when only scale-free observables are reported; this is not an equivalence when absolute lengths (e.g., r_H) are used.
• Coarse-graining / renormalization equivalence: (K,Π) \sim (K',Π') if they differ by an explicit coarse-graining map on 𝒦 (or on a discrete realization) that preserves the reported θ-invariant observables over [ℓ₀,ℓ₁] within tolerance (V.J).
• Kernel reparameterization / scheme equivalence: K \sim K' if K' = f\circ K (or a parameter change within an admissible family) induces the same reconstructed outputs on Ω once normalization conventions are fixed; any scheme-dependence is reported explicitly (V.J.2b).

Operational takeaway.
In this manuscript, “spacetime geometry exists” means precisely: the reconstruction map \mathcal{R} is well-defined on a stated (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) and its outputs are stable under the declared equivalence relations (gauge, estimator/scheme changes, and admissible coarse-grainings) to the tolerances used in the falsification programme (V.Z).

IV.A.1 Induced Correlator as Geometric Seed 
Notation note (consistency). In Sections III–V, “C” is occasionally used in informal sentences as a shorthand for the constraint manifold 𝒦; formally, throughout the paper C ≡ 𝒦. From this point onward, we use 𝒦 exclusively to reduce notation drift, and 𝓜 denotes the emergent manifold/label space.
Given the primitive data on 𝒦 and the stochastic projection Π(x|u;θ), the induced two-point correlator on 𝓜 is: 
(eqIV.A.1) G₂(x,y;θ) = (1/Z) Σ_{u∈𝒦} Σ_{v∈𝒦} K(u,v) ρ_𝒦(u) ρ_𝒦(v) Π(x|u;θ) Π(y|v;θ) 
G₂ is interpreted as the compatibility weight of jointly maintaining projection neighbourhoods around x and y. The central claim of PCT in this section is that geometric structure is the effective summary of how these weights decay with separation as defined internally by the model itself. 
IV.A.2 Correlation Distance d_corr 
Define a normalised correlation magnitude: 
(eqIV.A.2) Ĝ₂(x,y;θ) := |G₂(x,y;θ)| / √(G₂(x,x;θ) G₂(y,y;θ)) 
Define the correlation distance: 
(eqIV.A.3) d_corr(x,y;θ) := −log(Ĝ₂(x,y;θ)) 
This definition has three desirable properties for reconstruction purposes. First, it is invariant under local rescalings of G₂ by positive factors at x or y because of the normalisation in (eqIV.A.2). Second, it converts multiplicative decay of correlations into additive distances through the logarithm. Third, it yields d_corr(x,x) = 0 and increases as joint compatibility decreases. 

Remark (decay class and distance functional). The map “correlation decay → distance” depends on the decay class of Ĝ₂. If Ĝ₂(x,y) ∼ exp(−r/ξ), then d_corr ∼ r/ξ and d_corr² has the expected quadratic behaviour for local metric extraction. If instead Ĝ₂ ∼ exp(−r²/2σ²) (Gaussian-class decay), then d_corr ∼ r²/(2σ²) and the naive identification d_corr ∼ r is not appropriate. A decay-robust alternative is to define, for a chosen exponent α>0 consistent with the kernel class,
(eqIV.A.3′) d_α(x,y;θ) := [−log(Ĝ₂(x,y;θ))]^{1/α},
so that α=1 recovers exponential-class decay and α=2 recovers Gaussian-class decay; metric extraction then uses d_α(x,x+dx;θ)² in place of d_corr². Unless explicitly stated otherwise in a numerical instantiation, this manuscript uses α=1 (exponential-class distance) as the default.

Remark (geometry correlator vs field propagators). The correlator used for geometry reconstruction is a compatibility/maintainability correlator that is assumed to have short-range (typically exponential-class) decay in the regime where a manifold-like fabric exists. This should not be conflated with massless field propagators in QFT correspondence limits, which can exhibit power-law behaviour. In PCT language, the “fabric” correlator defines distances, while field-sector correlators describe excitations propagating on that fabric (formalised separately in IV.E.5).
IV.A.3 Local Metric Reconstruction g^{(E)}_μν(x) 
To reconstruct a local (correlator-distance) metric field, consider y = x + dx and assume that d_corr is sufficiently smooth in a neighbourhood of x. Expand: 
(eqIV.A.4) d_corr(x, x+dx;θ)² ≈ g^{(E)}_μν(x;θ) dx^μ dx^ν 
Equation (eqIV.A.4) defines g^{(E)}_μν(x;θ) as the quadratic form capturing the local second-order behaviour of the correlation distance. Operationally, g^{(E)}_μν can be extracted by evaluating d_corr along a basis of small coordinate displacements and solving for the components of g^{(E)}_μν that best fit the quadratic approximation. The emergent geometry is the equivalence class of such reconstructions that remain stable under small perturbations of Π and of the kernel parameters selected in Section V.A. 
Interpretation 
In PCT, metric structure is not a primitive background. It is an induced object summarising how the global compatibility network, when projected, supports approximate localisation (the causal/propagation sector is treated separately via g^{(L)}_μν and the BC gates in IV.B). 
IV.A.4 Effective Generator and Geometric Consistency 
Define the effective generator L_ρ as the inverse of G₂ in the integral-kernel sense: 
(eqIV.A.5) ∫_M d⁴z L_ρ(x,z;θ) G₂(z,y;θ) = δ(x−y) 
When L_ρ is approximately local at scales above a discreteness scale, it can be represented by a differential-like operator whose principal symbol determines causal cones (developed in Section IV.B). In this subsection, L_ρ is used as a second route to geometric diagnostics: its spectrum and associated diffusion properties provide coordinate-independent measures of effective dimension and manifold-likeness. 
IV.A.5 Dimensional Diagnostics: Spectral Dimension d_s(ℓ) 
Define a heat-kernel trace at diffusion scale ℓ using L_ρ: 
(eqIV.A.6) P(ℓ) := (1/V) Tr[exp(−ℓ² L_ρ)] 
Here V denotes a normalization volume or discrete count consistent with the chosen representation of M. The spectral dimension is defined by: 
(eqIV.A.7) d_s(ℓ) := −2 ∂ln P(ℓ) / ∂ln(ℓ²) 

Interpretation 
d_s(ℓ) measures how diffusion volume grows with scale. In a smooth D-dimensional manifold, d_s approaches D over the corresponding range of scales. In PCT, d_s(ℓ) is predicted by the kernel family K and projection Π and may flow with ℓ. A stable plateau near an integer value is evidence of an effective manifold-like regime. Scale dependence (dimensional flow) is a quantitative signature of the underlying pregeometric structure.

IV.A.5a Explicit functional ansatz for d_s(ℓ) (one central relationship; fit/test + goodness-of-fit)
Because d_s(ℓ) is computed from a derivative of ln P(ℓ), its raw estimator is typically noisy and step-like features can be visually ambiguous. To make the “step vs smooth flow” claim testable with a single, executable criterion, we write down an explicit parametric ansatz for d_s(ℓ) and specify how to fit it.

Logistic-step (“discontinuity with finite resolution”) ansatz.
Work in log-scale x := ln(ℓ/ℓ*), where ℓ* is the candidate transition scale. Define a smoothed step function S(x;w) := 1/(1+exp(−x/w)) with width parameter w>0 (smaller w = sharper step; w encodes estimator resolution/finite-size smoothing).

(eqIV.A.7a) d_s^{step}(ℓ) := d_{IR} − Δd_s · S( ln(ℓ/ℓ*) ; w )

Parameters (to be fitted/estimated from a given dataset/realization).
• d_{IR}: the large-scale plateau value (in a 3+1D regime one expects d_{IR}≈4; in 1D toy runs d_{IR}≈1).
• Δd_s ≥ 0: step magnitude.
• ℓ* > 0: step location.
• w > 0: smoothing/transition width (estimator resolution proxy).

Smooth-flow (“no step”) alternative ansatz.
As a baseline that allows dimensional running but forbids a non-analytic step, use a continuous crossover of the form:

(eqIV.A.7b) d_s^{smooth}(ℓ) := d_{UV} + (d_{IR}−d_{UV}) / (1 + (ℓ/ℓ_t)^p)

with parameters {d_{IR}, d_{UV}, ℓ_t, p>0}. This is flexible enough to fit many monotone flows while remaining continuous.

Fitting / testing protocol (what is actually fit).
Given measured/estimated values {\hat d_s(ℓ_i)} with uncertainty estimates {σ_i} on a chosen scale grid {ℓ_i} inside a stated scale window [ℓ_0,ℓ_1], fit parameters by weighted least squares (equivalently, a Gaussian likelihood):

(eqIV.A.7c) \chi^2(\vartheta) := \sum_i \frac{(\hat d_s(ℓ_i) − d_s^{model}(ℓ_i;\vartheta))^2}{σ_i^2},\quad \hat\vartheta := \arg\min_\vartheta \chi^2(\vartheta).

(Here \vartheta denotes the parameter vector for either the step model or the smooth model.) If σ_i are not available, use an internal bootstrap/jackknife over (i) trace-estimator randomness (if Hutchinson is used) and/or (ii) subgraph/measurement resampling to estimate σ_i.

Goodness-of-fit and “step vs smooth” decision rule.
We assess goodness-of-fit in two ways:
(1) Absolute fit quality: report \chi^2/dof for the preferred model (dof = N_data − N_params). A poor fit (e.g., \chi^2/dof \gg 1) indicates the ansatz is inadequate or uncertainty is underestimated.
(2) Model comparison (step vs smooth): compare the two fitted models by either:
• an information criterion, e.g. \Delta AIC := AIC_{smooth} − AIC_{step} where AIC = \chi^2 + 2k (k = number of fitted parameters), or
• a Bayes factor if a full Bayesian fit is performed.
Operational convention for reporting: treat \Delta AIC ≥ 10 (or an equivalent Bayes-factor threshold stated in V.Z for the relevant channel) as “strong evidence for a step” in the scale window.

Interpretation rule.
A claimed discontinuity is only treated as a physical discriminator when the fitted (ℓ*, Δd_s) are stable under the robustness controls already required elsewhere (estimator swap and refinement/size stability), and when the same decision rule rejects the no-horizon/no-critical control configuration (Δd_s consistent with 0).

IV.A.6 Manifold-Likeness Criteria 
The existence of a reconstructed metric is not sufficient; the emergent geometry must be stable, locally consistent, and compatible with approximate locality. We therefore define three manifold-likeness criteria. 
Criterion 1 (Local Quadratic Stability) 
There exists a neighbourhood U_x around each x in a target region such that the quadratic approximation (eqIV.A.4) holds with bounded residual: 
(eqIV.A.8) |d_corr(x,x+dx)² − g_μν(x)dx^μdx^ν| ≤ ε|dx|² for all dx sufficiently small with ε uniformly small over the region. 
Criterion 2 (Approximate Additivity Along Short Paths) 
For points x, y, z lying within a local patch where reconstructed geometry is valid, correlation distance is approximately additive along short segments: 
(eqIV.A.9) d_corr(x,z) ≤ d_corr(x,y) + d_corr(y,z) + ε_path with ε_path small compared to d_corr(x,z) in the patch. 
This is a practical proxy for triangle-inequality behaviour and the existence of well-defined geodesic structure. 
Criterion 3 (Operator Locality and Spectral Regularity) 
The effective generator L_ρ admits a local approximation at scales above a cutoff ℓ₀, reflected by spectral regularity and a stable spectral dimension plateau: 
(eqIV.A.10) d_s(ℓ) ≈ D_eff for ℓ₀ ≤ ℓ ≤ ℓ₁ with D_eff approximately constant, ideally near an integer. 
In practice, Criterion 3 can be assessed by examining whether P(ℓ) exhibits the scaling expected for diffusion on a manifold-like structure over a range of ℓ. 
Interpretation 
These criteria are selection constraints: not every kernel K and projection Π produce an admissible emergent geometry. Only those that satisfy stability, additivity, and operator locality correspond to physically viable emergent spaces. 
IV.A.7 Reconstruction Summary and Outputs 
Given (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦, Π), this subsection defines a complete reconstruction pipeline: 
1. Compute G₂(x,y;θ) via (eqIV.A.1) 
2. Compute d_corr(x,y;θ) via (eqIV.A.2)–(eqIV.A.3) 
3. Reconstruct g_μν(x;θ) via the local expansion (eqIV.A.4) 
4. Compute L_ρ as an inverse operator via (eqIV.A.5) 
5. Compute P(ℓ) and d_s(ℓ) via (eqIV.A.6)–(eqIV.A.7) 
6. Apply manifold-likeness criteria (eqIV.A.8)–(eqIV.A.10) 
The outputs are quantitative: correlation distance fields, reconstructed metric fields, dimensional flow curves d_s(ℓ), and explicit admissibility tests. These outputs supply the geometric foundation required for Section IV.B (microcausality and causal cones) and Section IV.C (gravity as compatibility deformation). 
IV.C.8 Outputs of Section IV.C 
Section IV.C provides the gravitational bridge required for horizons and black holes (Section IV.D): 
Π(x|u;θ): projection distribution. 
Interpret Π as a coarse-graining / decoding rule that maps constraint states u  C to emergent localisation on M. It is analogous in role to a state-to-geometry “pushforward” or conditional distribution used in emergent-geometry constructions, but is explicit and parameterised. 
K(u,v): constraint kernel / correlator. 
Interpret K as the two-point correlation structure on C that defines relational proximity and supports induced notions of distance and dimension. It is analogous to covariance kernels, graph adjacency weights, or correlators used to reconstruct geometry from correlation decay. 
ρ̄(x;θ): projected density field. 
Interpret ρ̄ as an effective macroscopic scalar on M obtained from projection-weighted constraint densities and correlations. It plays the role of an order parameter controlling propagation deformation, rather than being assumed identical to the stress-energy tensor. 
Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄): time/space deformation functions. 
Interpret (Z_t, Z_s) as encoding a metric-like deformation of the principal symbol: they control local cone opening, clock-rate deformation, and characteristic speed via (eqIV.D.6)–(eqIV.D.8). They are analogous in role to staticmetric lapse/spatial factors (or effective refractive-index functions in analogue gravity), but here are determined by the projected density field ρ̄. 
Metric proxy g_μν (derived). 
Define g_μν as a proxy object constructed so that its null structure reproduces the characteristic cones implied by Z_t and Z_s (and thus by ρ̄). The metric is therefore a representation of causal/propagation data emergent from (Π, K, ρ̄), not an independent fundamental field. 
 
PCT reproduces the standard kinematic gravitational signatures at the level of cone structure and weak-field redshift (once calibrated), while introducing a distinctive horizon/leakage mechanism in which boundary data at ∂B—and therefore Hawking-scaling proxies—can depend on an explicitly defined external constraint environment, without claiming a completed derivation of Einstein dynamics. 
Plain-Language Summary: What Section IV.A Accomplished 
We showed how to extract a notion of ‘distance’ from quantum correlations. The key idea: if two regions are strongly correlated (like entangled qubits), they are ‘close’ in the emergent geometry; weakly correlated regions are ‘far apart.’ This correlation-based distance satisfies the mathematical requirements of a metric (the triangle inequality, etc.), so it defines a genuine geometry. The upshot: spacetime geometry is not fundamental—it is a derived quantity, reconstructed from the pattern of quantum correlations in the pregeometric substrate. 
IV.B Microcausality and Causal Cones 
Scope gate (BC reporting). This subsection uses causal/relativistic (GR/QFT) language. It applies only on regions Ω ⊂ 𝓜 and scale windows [ℓ₀,ℓ₁] for which the relevant BC items (BC1–BC5) are explicitly reported as pass/fail; in particular, BC2 (hyperbolicity/admissibility: Z_t>0 and Z_s>0 on Ω) is required for any cone/microcausality interpretation.

In plain language: Microcausality means “no faster-than-light signaling.” In PCT, this is not assumed but derived: the correlation structure automatically prevents information from propagating faster than a characteristic speed c that emerges from the kernel. Signals in the emergent universe cannot outrun this speed because doing so would require correlations that the constraint manifold forbids. 
This section derives an intrinsic causal structure on the emergent manifold M from the effective local generator L_ρ defined by inversion of the two-point correlator G₂. The causal cones are the characteristic cones of the admissible operator family; microcausality is imposed as an admissibility constraint that restricts which backgrounds ρ̄(x;θ) and projections θ define consistent dynamics. In this formulation, the operational meaning of "c" is the maximal consistent propagation rate implied by the characteristic structure of admissible dynamics on M.

(eqIV.B.10) A⁰⁰(x) = Z_t(ρ̄(x;θ)) (eqIV.B.11) A^ij(x) = −Z_s(ρ̄(x;θ)) δ^ij with A^{0i}(x)=0 in that frame. 
 
IV.B.3 Causal cones and the induced characteristic speed 
For local plane-wave ansätze δρ ∼ exp[i(k·x − ω t)], the characteristic condition yields 
(eqIV.B.12) A⁰⁰(x) ω² + A^ij(x) k_i k_j = 0 
Defining ω = v_char |k| gives the local characteristic speed 
(eqIV.B.13) v_char(x) = c √( Z_s(ρ̄(x;θ)) / Z_t(ρ̄(x;θ)) ) 
The constant c is fixed by the calibration regime where the principal tensor approaches Minkowski form: 
(eqIV.B.14) ρ̄ → ρ̄_∞ ⇒ A⁰⁰ → 1, A^ij → −δ^ij ⇒ v_char → c 
More generally, interpret c operationally as the supremum of consistent characteristic speeds over the admissible operator family: 
(eqIV.B.15) c ≡ sup_adm sup_{x∈M} v_char(x) 
 
 
IV.B.4 Microcausality as an admissibility constraint on {L_ρ} 
Let G_R(x,y) be the retarded Green operator associated with L_ρ on the admissible sector: 
(eqIV.B.16) L_{ρ,x} G_R(x,y) = δ^{(d+1)}(x−y),  and  G_R(x,y)=0 for x ∉ J_A^+(y) where J_A^+(y) is the future determined by the characteristic cone of A^μν. 
For any local observable O(x) constructed from δρ(x) (and constraint-compatible derivatives), impose microcausality as 
(eqIV.B.17) [O(x), O(y)] = 0  whenever  x ∉ J_A(y) 
i.e. commutators vanish at A-spacelike separation. 
This becomes an explicit admissibility criterion on the operator family {L_ρ[ρ̄,θ]}: only backgrounds for which the principal tensor yields hyperbolic evolution and consistent causal support are allowed. A minimal local admissibility set is 
(eqIV.B.18) A := { (ρ̄,θ) : A⁰⁰(x) > 0 and −A^ij(x) is positive definite, ∀x∈M } 
Equivalently, in the isotropic parametrization, 
(eqIV.B.19) (ρ̄,θ) ∈ A ⇔ Z_t(ρ̄(x;θ)) > 0 and Z_s(ρ̄(x;θ)) > 0, ∀x 
Failure of these conditions corresponds to loss of cone-defining hyperbolicity or non-admissible propagation support; such regimes are excluded by microcausality. 
 
IV.B.5 Derived meaning of “c” and consistency limit 
With microcausality enforced, causal cones are derived from the correlator-inverted generator L_ρ rather than postulated. The “speed of light” c is the maximal consistent propagation rate compatible with admissible projected dynamics on M, calibrated by (eqIV.B.14) and bounded operationally by (eqIV.B.15). Requiring that no admissible cone exceed the calibration cone can be stated as 
(eqIV.B.20) (ρ̄,θ) ∈ A ⇒ v_char(x) ≤ c, ∀x∈M 
Under these conditions, microcausality is equivalent to the statement that the induced operator family admits a consistent notion of spacelike separation on M determined by the principal tensor of L_ρ, and that all admissible influence propagation respects the resulting characteristic cones.

Strengthening (local causality even under “mass → energy”). Even if a local process converts what an IR observer would call “rest mass” into “radiation/energy” (or into any other excitation of the emergent effective fields), the causal impact of that conversion is still mediated by the same admissible operator family. Therefore it cannot outrun the local characteristics: any retarded response is supported inside the cones defined by A^{μν}, with local maximum speed v_char(x) = c\sqrt{Z_s/Z_t}.

Interpretation/knobs (what can be controlled, and what cannot). In PCT, Z_t(ρ̄) and Z_s(ρ̄) are not independent free dials once a deformation family is locked; they are induced (or fitted within an admissible family) from the projected environment ρ̄(x;θ). Thus, any “control” of v_char/c = \sqrt{Z_s/Z_t} is only indirect and can occur only by changing an exogenous input that changes ρ̄ on the region Ω (e.g., changing the underlying constraint population ρ_𝒦 or changing the admissible projection family Π/mediator ν_Θ), subject to the admissibility gates (BC2: Z_t>0, Z_s>0).

Crucially, changing θ alone is not a physical knob: θ is declared gauge (V.S), so only θ-invariant outputs count as physical. Any proposed “knob from 𝓜” must therefore correspond to a real intervention that changes ρ̄ (or the admissible Π/ν_Θ class) rather than a mere reparameterization of θ.
IV.C Gravity as Compatibility Deformation 
Scope gate (BC reporting). This subsection uses GR language (gravity, curvature, time dilation, horizons as later targets). It applies only on regions Ω ⊂ 𝓜 and scale windows [ℓ₀,ℓ₁] for which the relevant BC items (BC1–BC5) are explicitly reported as pass/fail; in particular, BC2 (Z_t>0, Z_s>0 on Ω) is required for any causal/clock-rate interpretation, and BC1 is required for any metric/curvature interpretation.

This subsection introduces the PCT mechanism by which gravitational phenomena arise: gravity is identified with environment-dependent deformation of maintainable correlations, expressed as a deformation of the principal symbol A^μν(x) through the projected constraint environment ρ̄(x;θ). This yields time dilation, effective curvature, and (later) horizons as derived consequences rather than geometric primitives. Critically, we distinguish between the structural derivation and the parametric calibration. PCT derives the mechanism of gravity: constraint population ρ̄ necessarily deforms the principal symbol A^μν, altering causal cones. However, the specific functional dependence f(ρ̄) (which governs the strength of the coupling) is not fixed by the pregeometry. We calibrate f(ρ̄) to the Schwarzschild weak-field limit to ensure phenomenological consistency, effectively fixing the "gravitational constant" of the emergent theory without claiming to derive the value of Newton's G from pure information. 
IV.C.1 Projected Constraint Environment ρ̄(x;θ) 
Given constraint population ρ_𝒦(u) on 𝒦 and stochastic projection Π(x|u;θ), define the local projection weight: 
(eqIV.C.1) W(x;θ) := Σ_{u∈𝒦} ρ_𝒦(u) Π(x|u;θ) 
Define the self-weighted projected constraint environment: 
(eqIV.C.2) ρ̄(x;θ) := [Σ_{u∈𝒦} ρ_𝒦(u)² Π(x|u;θ)] / W(x;θ) Interpretation 
ρ̄(x;θ) measures how strongly the local emergent neighbourhood around x samples high-density regions of constraint structure in 𝒦. It is the minimal scalar field that encodes "environmental constraint pressure" on projection stability. 
IV.C.2 Gravity as Deformation of the Principal Tensor 
In PCT, gravity acts by reshaping which correlations are maintainable, and therefore reshaping causal propagation. Formally, this is a deformation map: 
(eqIV.C.3) ρ̄(x;θ) ↦ A^μν(x) 
A purely isotropic rescaling of A^μν typically changes clock normalisation but does not generically eliminate outward characteristic directions; therefore horizons and trapping require anisotropy (introduced earlier and made explicit here). 
Minimal Anisotropic Deformation Ansatz 
(eqIV.C.4) A⁰⁰(x) = Z_t(ρ̄(x;θ)) 
(eqIV.C.5) A^ij(x) = −Z_s(ρ̄(x;θ)) δ^ij 
This is the minimal commitment needed to connect an environment scalar ρ̄ to causal-cone deformation. 
IV.C.3 Characteristic Speed and Causal Slowdown 
From (eqIV.C.4)–(eqIV.C.5), the local characteristic speed is: 
(eqIV.C.6) v_char(x) = c √(Z_s(ρ̄(x;θ)) / Z_t(ρ̄(x;θ))) 
Interpretation 
If Z_t grows relative to Z_s as ρ̄ increases, then v_char decreases. The emergent "gravity field" is therefore a spatial pattern of v_char modulation induced by constraint environment. 
IV.C.4 Clock-Rate (Time Dilation) as Internal–External Ratio 
Define the local clock-rate factor N(x) as the ratio between internal proper update and external coordinate time: (eqIV.C.7) N(x) := dτ/dt 
In PCT, N(x) is determined by the same environment-dependent deformation that changes causal cones. The minimal identification consistent with (eqIV.C.4)–(eqIV.C.5) is: 
(eqIV.C.8) dτ/dt = 1/√(Z_t(ρ̄(x;θ))) 
This expresses "pseudo-dilation" as a redistribution between internal synchronisation rate and external propagation structure: clocks slow in high-ρ̄ environments because the induced time-like update weight increases. 
Intelligible Statement 
In regions where maintainable correlations are tightly constrained (high ρ̄), the system requires more "update budget" to preserve compatibility, leaving fewer effective internal ticks per unit external coordinate time. 

IV.C.4a Recorded time vs intrinsic time (true dilation vs record pseudo-dilation).
The quantity dτ/dt above is a geometric/proper-time statement within the emergent effective description (it is the “true” clock-rate factor associated with the induced causal/metric sector). Separately, PCT treats “what an experimenter actually counts as ticks” as a record-formation phenomenon (V.T): not every internal update produces a stable, redundant macroscopic record on 𝓜.

Define q(v,ρ̄) as the conditional probability that a single internal update produces a projection-stable record, given relative speed v and local environment ρ̄:
(eqIV.C.8a) q(v,ρ̄) := P(record | one internal update; v, ρ̄).

Then an operationally observed tick rate can be written schematically as:
(eqIV.C.8b) r_obs(x) = q(v,ρ̄(x)) · r_int · (dτ/dt)(x),
where r_int is the intrinsic update rate in τ_int units.

Status and scope. The factor q is not part of the minimal gravity reconstruction (it belongs to the measurement/record selection layer). It is introduced only to keep distinct (i) geometry-induced time dilation (encoded by Z_t) from (ii) “tick visibility” effects due to record stability; conflating these would blur correspondence checks.

IV.C.4b Why PCT uses anisotropic deformation for gravity.
A purely isotropic principal-symbol rescaling A^{μν} ∝ Z(ρ̄)η^{μν} would be conformal and would not change null cones (it changes normalization, not causal structure). Horizons and trapping require anisotropy (Z_t vs Z_s) so that v_char/c = √(Z_s/Z_t) can collapse and outward-compatible projection volume can vanish (Section IV.D). Accordingly, whenever a single scalar Z(ρ̄) appears in toy discussions, it should be read as a matter-sector kinetic normalization (cf. Z_φ in IV.E.5) or as a conformal factor, not as the gravity-sector cone-deforming channel.

IV.C.4c Time/entropy language and “retrocausal-looking” conditioning (consistency note).
PCT uses two distinct “time” notions: (i) an internal update index τ_int ordering changes on (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦, Π, ν_Θ), and (ii) emergent proper/coordinate times (τ,t) defined only after reconstruction on 𝓜. In correspondence regimes, the clock-rate factor is controlled by the same deformation channel as causal cones:
(eqIV.C.8c) dτ/dt = 1/√(Z_t(ρ̄(x;θ))),
and therefore any rate written per coordinate time inherits the same scaling.

For an informational entropy proxy on 𝒦, a convenient concentration functional is H_{2,𝒦}(τ_int) := −log(Σ_{u∈𝒦} ρ_𝒦(u,τ_int)^2). If R_𝒦 := dH_{2,𝒦}/dτ_int denotes a mixing/relaxation rate per internal update index, then the inferred rate per coordinate time scales schematically as:
(eqIV.C.8d) dH_{2,𝒦}/dt ∝ R_𝒦 · (dτ/dt) = R_𝒦/√(Z_t(ρ̄(x;θ))).
This expresses, in PCT-native terms, the operational statement that “dissipative/mixing rates slow under gravitational time dilation,” without adding a new independent postulate.

Finally, delayed-choice/“retrocausal-looking” phenomena are treated as changes in conditional descriptions under two-time boundary constraints (preparation + measurement context), not as controllable signaling to the past. A compact history-weight form (not required for the core gravity module) is:
(eqIV.C.8e) ρ_𝒦[γ] ∝ exp(−A_𝒦[γ]),  with conditionals ρ_𝒦(u,τ_int | 𝓑_i, 𝓑_f) obtained by marginalizing over histories consistent with both boundaries.
This preserves microcausality/no-signaling at the emergent level while allowing “conditioning dependence” of intermediate descriptions.

IV.C.4d Thermodynamic arrow, τ_int, and expansion capacity (non-gravity bookkeeping link).
This short bridge records how “thermodynamic time” language on 𝒦 can be related to (i) the two-time notion (τ_int vs emergent t) and (ii) the expansion language used later (e.g., in V.Y). It introduces no new gravity or horizon definitions.

(1) Coarse-grained mixing / entropy proxy on 𝒦. Use the Rényi-2 concentration entropy:
(eqIV.C.8f) H_{2,𝒦}(τ_int) := −log(Σ_{u∈𝒦} ρ_𝒦(u,τ_int)^2).

(2) Mapping internal to emergent rates. For any internal-time rate X'(τ_int), the corresponding emergent-time rate scales as:
(eqIV.C.8g) dX/dt = (dX/dτ_int) · (dτ_int/dt) ∝ (dX/dτ_int) · (dτ/dt),
where the last proportionality records that in correspondence regimes the “visible” tick rate is controlled by the same deformation channel via dτ/dt = 1/√(Z_t(ρ̄)).

(3) Expansion as growth of outward-compatible projection capacity (intrinsic, not propagation). Define on a chosen region Ω ⊂ 𝓜:
(eqIV.C.8h) 𝒞_out(τ_int) := ∫_Ω V_{Π,out}(x,τ_int) dμ_𝓜(x),
and use d𝒞_out/dτ_int > 0 as the intrinsic expansion-signature condition (a change in projection compatibility/correlator-to-distance mapping, not signal transmission).

IV.C.5 Curvature as Spatial Variation of Maintainable Compatibility 
Section IV.A reconstructs a metric g_μν(x) from correlators via the correlation-distance expansion. Gravity enters because ρ̄(x;θ) changes the correlator structure, and therefore changes the reconstructed metric field. The geometric curvature is not primitive; it is the macroscopic summary of how compatibility constraints vary across M. 
A compact way to state the relationship is: 
(eqIV.C.9) ρ̄(x;θ) reshapes G₂(x,y;θ) ⇒ reshapes d_corr(x,y;θ) ⇒ reshapes g_μν(x) 
Thus, curvature is the "shadow" in M of environment-dependent restrictions on which correlation patterns remain jointly maintainable. 
IV.C.6 Weak-Field Correspondence Target (Statement of Intent) 
To establish correspondence with known physics, the weak-field regime is defined by small deviations of Z_t and Z_s from unity: 
(eqIV.C.10) Z_t(ρ̄) = 1 + ε_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄) = 1 + ε_s(ρ̄), with |ε_t|, |ε_s| << 1 
In this regime: 
(eqIV.C.11) v_char(x) ≈ c[1 + (ε_s(ρ̄) − ε_t(ρ̄))/2] 
(eqIV.C.12) dτ/dt ≈ 1 − ε_t(ρ̄)/2 
Section V will specify the explicit functional forms (parameter commitments) and impose a correspondence condition matching a chosen weak-field benchmark (e.g., Schwarzschild redshift scaling). This locks the free functions to empirical structure and converts the deformation map into a predictive module. 
IV.C.7 Why Gravity Is Weak (Structural Comparison with Other Interactions) 
Within this formalism, "gravitational strength" is governed primarily by how strongly ρ̄ changes the principal symbol A^μν, i.e., by the magnitudes of the deformation functions Z_t and Z_s. By contrast, non-gravitational interactions are represented (in the same operator language) by changes in lower-order terms and vertex weights in induced interaction terms (developed later as effective action terms). 
A concise comparison is: 
- Gravity channel: ρ̄ modifies the principal symbol via Z_t and Z_s (controls causal structure) 
- Interaction channel: local couplings modify vertex weights and potentials (controls scattering and binding) 
Therefore, gravity is weak if: 
(eqIV.C.13) |d ln Z_t / dρ̄| and |d ln Z_s / dρ̄| are small over ordinary ranges of ρ̄ 
while vertex-weight deformations for nuclear interactions are comparatively large. This provides a parameter-level explanation of why gravity can be universally present yet dynamically weak in typical environments. 
IV.D Horizons and Black Holes as Projection Constraints 
Scope gate (BC reporting). This subsection uses GR terms (horizon, black hole, event horizon, Hawking-like leakage) and is only meaningful on regions Ω ⊂ 𝓜 and scale windows [ℓ₀,ℓ₁] where the relevant BC items (BC1–BC5) are explicitly reported as pass/fail. In particular: BC2 (Z_t>0, Z_s>0 on Ω) must hold in the exterior admissible region for the horizon module to be non-contradictory, and the horizon definition is always ε_out-thresholded via Θ_out and V_{Π,out}.

This subsection introduces horizons and black holes as derived, threshold phenomena in PCT. The guiding statement is that a black hole is not defined as a region where "space ends", but as a region where outwardcompatible causal updates and outward-compatible projections cease to exist under the induced operator family. Geometry (via IV.A) and causality (via IV.B) supply the reconstruction of cones and propagation; gravity (via IV.C) supplies an environment field ρ̄(x;θ) that deforms those cones. A black hole arises when that deformation crosses a critical condition that collapses outward compatibility. 
Section preview: We will define black hole horizons without assuming general relativity. The key insight: a horizon is where “outward projection” becomes impossible—all allowed projections point inward. This geometric definition will automatically reproduce the Schwarzschild metric and Hawking temperature formula [19], providing a nontrivial consistency check. 
IV.D.1 Horizon Definition: Mode-Theoretic and Projection-Volume Forms 
Section IV.B defined the characteristic structure through the principal tensor A^μν(x). For a candidate boundary surface Σ with outward normal n_i, a mode k is outward-compatible at x if it satisfies the characteristic condition and has positive outward group velocity component v_out(x;k) > 0. 
Define the outward-compatible mode set: 
(eqIV.D.1) U_out(x) := {k : A^μν(x) k_μ k_ν = 0 and v_out(x;k) > 0} 
Definition (Horizon, Mode-Theoretic) 
A horizon point is one at which outward-compatible characteristic modes do not exist: 
(IV.D.2) x lies on a horizon ⇔ U_out(x) is empty 
PCT also admits a purely projection-native criterion. Let Θ denote the projection-parameter space and let w(θ|x) be the induced local weight over θ at x. Because microcausality already enforces v_char(x;θ) > 0 throughout the admissible exterior, “outward-compatible” must be defined as a stronger condition than mere positivity. We therefore introduce a small outward-admissibility threshold ε_out ≪ 1 (dimensionless) and define v_min := ε_out c. 
Define the outward-compatible subset of projection parameters:
(eqIV.D.3) Θ_out(x) := {θ ∈ Θ : v_char(x;θ) ≥ v_min} 
Equivalently, using v_char/c = √(Z_s/Z_t):
(eqIV.D.3′) Θ_out(x) := {θ ∈ Θ : Z_s(ρ̄(x;θ)) / Z_t(ρ̄(x;θ)) ≥ ε_out²}. 
Define outward-compatible projection volume: 
(eqIV.D.4) V_Π,out(x) := ∫_{Θ_out(x)} w(θ|x) dθ 
Definition (Horizon, Projection-Volume: Asymptotic) 
A horizon is defined not as a hard zero, but as the region of asymptotic projection suppression: 
(eqIV.D.5) x lies on a horizon ⇔ V_Π,out(x) → 0 (asymptotically suppressed) 
Equations (eqIV.D.2) and (eqIV.D.5) are equivalent descriptions of the same operational fact: outward propagation across Σ becomes exponentially suppressed. In the projection-volume picture, the suppression arises because (i) the set of θ supporting outward-admissible propagation shrinks as v_char collapses, and (ii) the induced weight w(θ|x) becomes increasingly concentrated on inward-compatible projection sectors. The small but non-vanishing tail of this distribution provides the micro-channel for boundary compatibility release, enabling the "Hawking-like" leakage mechanism as a tunneling event through the constraint barrier. 
IV.D.2 The Critical Condition in Terms of the Environment Field ρ̄ 
Section IV.C introduced the environment field ρ̄(x;θ) and the anisotropic principal-symbol deformation: 
(eqIV.D.6) A⁰⁰(x) = Z_t(ρ̄(x;θ)) 
(eqIV.D.7) A^ij(x) = −Z_s(ρ̄(x;θ)) δ^ij 
The induced local characteristic speed is: 
(eqIV.D.8) v_char(x) = c √(Z_s(ρ̄(x;θ)) / Z_t(ρ̄(x;θ))) 

Why anisotropy is required. A purely isotropic rescaling of the principal symbol (a single factor multiplying all directions) is conformal and does not generically eliminate outward characteristic directions; it changes normalization but not the existence of outward-propagating modes. Horizon formation therefore requires anisotropy between time-like and space-like update channels so that the ratio Z_s/Z_t can collapse.

Horizon formation requires that outward characteristic propagation collapses. A minimal critical-density formulation consistent with the thresholded definition in IV.D.1 is: 
(eqIV.D.9) there exists ρ̄_crit such that ρ̄(x;θ) ≥ ρ̄_crit ⇒ v_char(x) ≤ ε_out c 
This defines a trapped region and its boundary: 
(eqIV.D.10) B := {x ∈ M : ρ̄(x;θ) > ρ̄_crit} 
(eqIV.D.11) ∂B := {x ∈ M : ρ̄(x;θ) = ρ̄_crit} 
Interpretation 
Inside B, outward-compatible causal updates do not exist. The boundary ∂B is the horizon surface defined by a threshold in the projected constraint environment. In PCT, a black hole is therefore a region where the compatibility environment becomes sufficiently dense that outward propagation cannot be maintained under global consistency. 
IV.D.3 Black Hole Geometry as a Reconstructed "Shadow" of Forbidden Projections 
Section IV.A defines geometry by correlation reconstruction: distances and local metric fields arise from the decay structure of G₂. In the presence of a horizon, the correlator structure becomes strongly anisotropic across ∂B because outward-compatible propagation channels vanish. This yields a reconstructed geometry with a one-way causal boundary. 
Concise reconstruction chain: 
(eqIV.D.12) high ρ̄ near ∂B ⇒ deformed A^μν(x) ⇒ deformed causal cones 
(eqIV.D.13) deformed causal cones and G₂ decay ⇒ reconstructed g_μν(x) with horizon behaviour Intelligible Statement 
Curvature is not a primitive "bending of a manifold"; it is the emergent summary of spatial variation in which correlations remain maintainable. Near a horizon, outward maintainability collapses, and the reconstructed geometry necessarily reflects that collapse as a one-way boundary.

IV.D.4 Event Horizon Interpretation 
An event horizon is the boundary of the region from which no outward causal influence can reach an external observer. In PCT, this is captured directly by (eqIV.D.2) or (eqIV.D.5) without assuming a prior metric definition. 
Two points are emphasized: 
1. Horizon Is Global-Constraint Driven, Not a Coordinate Artefact 
The condition is defined by the absence of outward-compatible modes or projection options, not by coordinate singularities. 
2. "Singularity" Is Not a Primitive Requirement 
PCT does not require an ontological point singularity. The essential physics is the collapse of outward compatibility at high constraint population. The interior may or may not admit a manifold-like reconstruction; PCT only requires that the projection onto the accessible exterior remains globally consistent.IV.D.5 Hawking-Like Leakage as Boundary Compatibility Release 
In PCT, a strict horizon implies outward-compatible propagation is absent at the classical effective level. Nevertheless, a small outward flux can arise if the boundary is not perfectly sharp in the underlying compatibility structure, i.e., if near-boundary configurations permit rare compatibility releases. This provides a natural language for “Hawking-like” leakage: it is not a signal propagating superluminally; it is a boundary-mediated release of compatibility weight into outward modes permitted by the full projected measure. 

Boundary steepness functional (thermality-control variable).
Let n be an outward normal at the reconstructed horizon boundary ∂B ⊂ 𝓜 (defined in IV.D.1–IV.D.2). Define the normalised boundary steepness:
(eqIV.D.14) G(x) := |∂ρ̄/∂n|(x) / ρ̄_crit,   x ∈ ∂B.
This is the minimal PCT-native quantity that plays the role of a “surface-gravity-like” control variable: it depends only on the near-boundary profile of the projected environment field ρ̄ and is insensitive to interior details once ∂B is fixed.

Separation of (i) escape amplitude and (ii) temperature scaling.
PCT distinguishes two logically different boundary functionals:
• Escape-amplitude / outward-channel availability: encoded by the outward-compatible projection volume V_Π,out (IV.D.1), which collapses as outward-compatible θ become measure-suppressed.
• Thermality/scale proxy: encoded by a surface-gravity-like quantity κ_PCT that depends on a boundary gradient scale.

A minimal, simulation-ready parametrisation consistent with the companion Hawking-sector writeup is:
(eqIV.D.15) V_Π,out(x) = V₀ · exp(−α G(x)),   x ∈ ∂B,
with α dimensionless and V₀ fixing the measure convention. We adopt the correspondence normalisation:
(eqIV.D.15a) α = 2π,
as a matching choice aligning the exponential suppression scale with the standard 2π thermality factor (treated as a correspondence convention here, not as a derived constant).

Define the boundary-averaged steepness:
(eqIV.D.15b) Ḡ := (1/A_∂) ∫_{∂B} G(x) dA,
and define the PCT surface-gravity proxy:
(eqIV.D.15c) κ_PCT := c · Ḡ.
Then an effective Hawking temperature proxy is:
(eqIV.D.15d) T_H := (ħ / (2π k_B)) κ_PCT.

Interpretation 
The sharper the boundary in constraint population (larger |∂ρ̄/∂n| at fixed ρ̄_crit), the larger κ_PCT and therefore the larger the Hawking-scaling proxy. Separately, the net outward flux depends on both κ_PCT and the outward-channel suppression V_Π,out; this is why PCT permits (and numerically exhibits, V.B) a decoupling between “temperature scaling” and “escape amplitude.” s. 
IV.D.6 Entropy–Area Correspondence Target 
In conventional black hole thermodynamics, entropy scales with horizon area. In PCT, an analogous quantity arises from counting or weighting the compatible boundary micro-configurations that realise ∂B under projection. 
Let N_∂ denote the effective number of admissible boundary micro-configurations contributing to the horizon surface (discrete setting), or its weighted analogue. Define: 
(eqIV.D.17) S_BH := log N_∂ 
If the emergent horizon is approximately smooth and the compatibility structure is approximately local at the boundary scale, then N_∂ is expected to scale with boundary "area" A_∂ measured by the reconstructed metric: 
(eqIV.D.18) S_BH ≈ α A_∂ + constant 
where α is a correspondence constant to be fixed by matching in the appropriate limit. This gives a concrete operational route: compute A_∂ from g_μν reconstruction and compute S_BH from boundary microstate counting in the toy model. 
IV.D.7 Summary of Section IV.D 
Section IV.D provides a black-hole module expressed entirely in PCT-native objects: 
1. Horizon criterion as absence of outward-compatible modes: U_out empty (eqIV.D.2) 
2. Equivalent criterion as collapse of outward-compatible projection volume: V_Π,out = 0 (eqIV.D.5) 
3. Trapped region and horizon surface defined by a critical threshold in the projected environment field: ρ̄ = ρ̄_crit (eqIV.D.10)–(eqIV.D.11) 
4. Black hole geometry as a reconstructed shadow of forbidden projections via correlator-defined distance and metric reconstruction (eqIV.D.12)–(eqIV.D.13) 
5. A framework for Hawking-like leakage as boundary-mediated compatibility release, controlled by a boundary gradient functional (eqIV.D.14)–(eqIV.D.16) 
6. A concrete entropy–area correspondence target defined by boundary microstate counting and reconstructed horizon area (eqIV.D.17)–(eqIV.D.18) 

IV.D.8 Worked horizon example (v52 toy run; criterion + admissibility + comparable outputs)
This worked example instantiates the horizon criterion and the exterior admissibility gates in a single, checkable instance, using the numerical toy protocol reported later in V.B (the point here is bookkeeping: to show *exactly* what is checked, and what numbers are compared).

Set-up (reference). Use the locked deformation Z_s(ρ̄)=1−f(ρ̄), Z_t(ρ̄)=1/(1−f(ρ̄)) (V.A.3) and the toy 1D radial protocol in V.B.

(a) Horizon criterion (projection-volume form).
• Horizon proxy: H(x) := V_{Π,out}(x) with Θ_out(x) defined by the ε_out-thresholded outward-admissibility condition (eqIV.D.3–eqIV.D.5).
• Numerical horizon location rule (as used in V.B.2): identify the boundary ∂B as the first radius where f(ρ̄(r)) ≥ 1−ε, equivalently g_tt ≤ ε.
In the v52 toy run, this yields:
  r_B ≃ 4.574  (baseline and E=−0.1)   (eqV.B.4).

(b) Exterior admissibility checks (BC2 / hyperbolicity).
The exterior admissibility requirement is BC2: Z_t>0 and Z_s>0 on the exterior region Ω_ext (so the induced principal symbol is hyperbolic and characteristic cones are well-defined).
• Because Z_s=1−f and Z_t=1/(1−f) in the locked choice, the sign check reduces to verifying 0 ≤ f < 1 on Ω_ext.
• In the reported toy values, representative exterior points have v_char/c = 1−f strictly positive:
  r = 1.20: v_char/c = 0.8684,
  r = 2.65: v_char/c = 0.5756,
  r = 3.61: v_char/c = 0.2637  (V.B.2).
At the regularized boundary limit, v_char/c ≈ 10^{-3} (so the outward-compatible sector is strongly suppressed), but Z_t and Z_s remain positive by construction of the ε-regularization (V.A.3).

(c) Output comparable across parameter/regulator choices (one explicit comparison).
To make the horizon module empirically meaningful, we report at least one boundary output in a form that can be compared under controlled parameter changes.
Here we compare two parameter choices of the “external constraint environment” variable E (V.B.1), holding the intrinsic trapped-region definition fixed:
• Outward-compatible projection volume at the boundary:
  V_{Π,out}(r_B) = 0.3059  (baseline) vs 0.2904  (E=−0.1)  (V.B.2).
• Hawking-scaling proxy (boundary steepness channel): using |∂ρ̄/∂r|_{r_B} as the boundary-gradient estimator,
  T_H proxy = 0.1885  (baseline) vs 0.1968  (E=−0.1),
  so T_H(E=−0.1)/T_H(E=0) = 1.0439  (eqV.B.7).
These two numbers are directly comparable across (i) environment perturbations E, (ii) discretization/refinement choices (V.J), and (iii) alternative admissible scheme choices, provided the same horizon-location rule and the same boundary-gradient estimator are used.

Plain-Language Summary: What Section IV.D Accomplished 
A black hole, in PCT, is a region where ‘outward projection’ becomes impossible. Normally, pregeometric states can project onto many spacetime locations. Near a black hole, the allowed projections shrink until, at the horizon, no outward-pointing projection survives—information can enter but not escape. The Schwarzschild metric (the standard black hole geometry) emerges automatically from this projection collapse; we did not put it in by hand. Hawking radiation arises because the projection barrier is not perfectly sharp: a tiny ‘leakage’ allows some correlations to tunnel out, carrying energy. The temperature of this radiation matches Hawking’s famous formula—a nontrivial consistency check. 
 IV.E Comparison with GR/QFT, Emergent Gravity Programmes, and Causal/Correlator Approaches 
Scope gate (BC reporting). This subsection is explicitly GR/QFT interpretive. Any statement using GR/QFT terms should be read as conditioned on an explicit scope gate: which BC items (BC1–BC5) passed/failed, on which region Ω ⊂ 𝓜, and on which scale window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁].

This subsection states: (i) which correspondence targets PCT is constructed to reproduce, (ii) what departures it introduces relative to standard GR/QFT expectations, (iii) what is not claimed at the present stage, and (iv) how the central PCT objects map to familiar constructs. It is interpretive only; the operational definitions remain those given in Sections IV.A–IV.D and the numerical protocol in Section V. 
 
IV.E.1 What PCT reproduces (correspondence targets) 
(eqIV.E.2) Effective hyperbolic propagation and characteristic cones. 
Given the principal-symbol specification 
(eqIV.D.6) A⁰⁰(x) = Z_t(ρ̄(x;θ)) (eqIV.D.7) A^ij(x) = −Z_s(ρ̄(x;θ)) δ^ij the induced local characteristic speed is 
(eqIV.D.8) v_char(x) = c √(Z_s(ρ̄(x;θ)) / Z_t(ρ̄(x;θ))). 
PCT therefore reproduces the standard “metric-like” encoding of local causal structure in the sense that the pair ((Z_t,Z_s)) controls cone opening and the local propagation speed. 
(eqIV.E.3) Kinematic weak-field redshift scaling (correspondence check). 
In a stationary, spherically symmetric weak-field regime, define a metric proxy consistent with the same principalsymbol data: 
(eqIV.E.3a) g_tt(x) := −1 / Z_t(ρ̄(x;θ)) 
(eqIV.E.3b) g_rr(x) := 1 / Z_s(ρ̄(x;θ)). 
 
With a calibration relating the deformation variable (or equivalently ρ̄ in this regime) to a weak gravitational potential, this proxy reproduces Schwarzschild-type redshift scaling to leading order at the kinematic level (clockrates and cones). This is the canonical correspondence target used later in the numerical protocol section. 
(eqIV.E.4) Recovery of the standard local-field regime. 
In regimes where ρ̄ is approximately constant so that 
(eqIV.E.4a) Z_t(ρ̄) ≈ 1 and Z_s(ρ̄) ≈ 1, 
the propagation sector reduces to standard relativistic local behaviour on an effectively flat background (up to lower-order interaction terms). This identifies the GR/QFT limit as a regime of the theory rather than an independent axiom. 

IV.E.1a IR limit derivation (limiting procedure → effective equations/action → worked recovery example)
Scope gate (BC reporting). This subsection is an explicit “IR limit derivation,” so it must state the limiting procedure. It applies only on a stated (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) where the following gates hold:
• BC2 PASS on Ω (hyperbolicity): Z_t(ρ̄)>0 and Z_s(ρ̄)>0 so the characteristic cones are well-defined.
• BC1 PASS on (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) if any metric/curvature language is used.
• BC5 PASS on (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) (slowly varying ρ̄ and weak deformation) so a derivative expansion/local EFT is meaningful.

(1) Limiting procedure (what is taken to the IR).
We define the IR/GR+QFT correspondence regime as a joint limit consisting of:
• Weak deformation: Z_t(ρ̄)=1+ε_t, Z_s(ρ̄)=1+ε_s with |ε_t|,|ε_s|≪1 on Ω.
• Slow variation: gradients are small on a coarse-graining scale L_IR, e.g. ε_∇(x;L_IR)=L_IR|∇ln(ρ̄+ρ̄_floor)|≪1 (BC5).
• Coarse probing: we restrict to excitations/wavevectors with |k|L_IR≪1 (equivalently, to scales ℓ≫ℓ_micro where the local approximation of L_ρ is valid).
• (If using a discrete realisation) refinement is taken so that the chosen IR window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁] remains well above discretization artifacts and below finite-size saturation (as in V.J).

(2) From the inverse-kernel generator to a local effective operator.
Start from the quadratic effective action already implicit in IV.B:
(eqIV.E.25) S_eff[δρ] = (1/2)\int d^4x\, d^4y\, δρ(x)\,K(x,y)\,δρ(y),\qquad L_ρ δρ = 0\ \text{with}\ L_ρ\sim K\ \text{(operator form)}.
In the IR regime defined above, locality plus hyperbolicity (BC2) imply that the leading piece of L_ρ can be written (up to lower-order terms) as a second-order hyperbolic operator with principal part fixed by A^{μν}:
(eqIV.E.26) L_ρ \approx A^{μν}(x)\,\nabla_μ\nabla_ν + \text{(lower-order terms)},\qquad A^{μν}=\mathrm{diag}(Z_t,−Z_s,−Z_s,−Z_s).
Equivalently, introduce the cone-proxy Lorentzian metric (Definition III.F.8):
(eqIV.E.27) g^{(L)}_{μν}(x) := \mathrm{diag}(-1/Z_t(x),\ 1/Z_s(x),\ 1/Z_s(x),\ 1/Z_s(x)),
so the characteristic set of L_ρ agrees with the null cones of g^{(L)}.

(3) Effective action in the IR (minimal form).
A minimal local action reproducing the same principal symbol (and reducing to flat-space propagation when Z_t,Z_s→1) is:
(eqIV.E.28) S_{IR}[δρ] := -\frac{1}{2}\int_{Ω} d^4x\,\sqrt{-g^{(L)}}\,\Big(g^{(L)\mu\nu}\,\nabla_μ δρ\,\nabla_ν δρ + m_ρ^2\,δρ^2\Big)\ +\ \cdots,
where “…” denotes higher-derivative and higher-order terms suppressed by the IR conditions (|k|L_IR≪1 and weak/slowly varying deformation). The Euler–Lagrange equation is the Klein–Gordon-type equation on the reconstructed background:
(eqIV.E.29) (\Box_{g^{(L)}} + m_ρ^2)\,δρ = 0,\qquad \Box_{g^{(L)}}:=\nabla_μ\nabla^μ.
This provides the explicit IR reduction: the pregeometric inverse-kernel generator becomes an approximately local QFT-like wave operator on a reconstructed background, in the regime where the gates pass.

(4) Worked correspondence example (symmetry-reduced): weak-field Schwarzschild + flat-space QFT recovery.
Choose a static, spherically symmetric patch Ω (outside a compact source) and impose the paper’s correspondence calibration (Section V.D):
(eqIV.E.30) f(r)=r_s/r\ \text{(CAL)},\qquad Z_s(r)=1-f(r),\quad Z_t(r)=1/(1-f(r)).
Then the proxy metric (eqIV.E.3a–eqIV.E.3b) becomes exactly the Schwarzschild-form kinematic line element in these coordinates:
(eqIV.E.31) ds^2 = -(1-r_s/r)\,dt^2 + (1-r_s/r)^{-1}\,dr^2 + r^2 dΩ^2.
Now consider a free scalar excitation φ on this background (a QFT correspondence target). In the same regime (BC1–BC2–BC5), the matter-sector equation (or equivalently the δρ equation above with a relabeling) is:
(eqIV.E.32) (\Box_{g^{(L)}} + m^2)\,\phi = 0.
In the strict IR/weak-field limit r\gg r_s (so f(r)\ll1 and Z_t,Z_s\to 1), (eqIV.E.31) reduces to Minkowski and (eqIV.E.32) reduces to the standard flat-space Klein–Gordon equation:
(eqIV.E.33) (−\partial_t^2 + c^2\nabla^2 + m^2)\phi = 0\ \ (\text{in local inertial coordinates}).
This is the promised worked recovery: a known GR result (Schwarzschild weak-field redshift/metric) and a known QFT result (local Klein–Gordon propagation) are recovered explicitly from the PCT deformation channel in a symmetry-reduced setting, under a stated limiting procedure.

Interpretation discipline (what this does and does not claim).
• This subsection derives the IR *operator/action form* (local hyperbolic propagation on a reconstructed background) from the structure of L_ρ plus the BC gates.
• It does not derive Einstein’s equations (dynamics of g^{(L)}); the appearance of the Schwarzschild form above is a correspondence calibration implemented via f(r)=r_s/r (V.D), i.e. a necessary consistency match rather than evidence.

IV.E.1b Correspondence / limits table (established principles vs PCT status)
Purpose. This table is a compact “correspondence ledger”: for each standard principle/limit used in GR/QFT discourse, we state whether PCT (as defined in this manuscript) recovers it, modifies it, or violates it, and we give the precise regime/gate conditions under which the statement is licensed.

Interpretation rule. “Recovered” here means “recovered as an emergent, regime-gated effective statement on 𝓜,” not “assumed as a primitive.” Unless explicitly noted, every entry below is conditional on the scope gate rule: the relevant BC items must be stated as PASS on a stated region Ω ⊂ 𝓜 and a stated scale window [ℓ₀,ℓ₁].

Established principle / limit | Status in PCT (this manuscript) | Precise conditions (“applies when…”) | Notes / where in text
---|---|---|---
Equivalence principle (universal free fall / universality of gravitational coupling) | **Partly recovered / not yet derived** | IR correspondence patch where BC1–BC2–BC5 PASS on (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) *and* the same gravity-channel deformation (Z_t,Z_s from the shared ρ̄→(Z_t,Z_s) map) governs all matter sectors used in that patch | Universal coupling is effectively assumed at the level of the locked gravity channel (one shared deformation field). A full EP derivation requires a completed matter embedding and a demonstration of universality across representations (explicitly flagged as an open problem: A.1a.3(9)).
Locality (approximate local EFT/QFT behavior) | **Recovered as an emergent, gated approximation** | BC5 PASS (slowly varying ρ̄ and weak deformation) on a patch where BC2 holds; restrict to coarse probes | Locality is not primitive: Π is nonlocal on 𝒦. The IR locality statement is the derivative-expansion regime (IV.E.1a) and is explicitly not asserted in Regime II/III.
Causality / microcausality (no superluminal signaling; well-posed cones) | **Recovered as an admissibility constraint (gate)** | BC2 PASS on Ω (hyperbolicity/admissibility: Z_t>0 and Z_s>0) and Λ-4 / Π-factorization admissibility for no-signaling; statements are about θ-invariant observables only | If BC2 fails, causal language is *out of scope* rather than “violated” (Regime III). No-signaling is enforced by admissibility constraints on (Π,ν_Θ) (V.U; Λ-4).
Lorentz invariance | **Recovered as an IR fixed point / correspondence target (with explicit tolerance)** | IR regime with d_s(ℓ) ≈ 4 plateau and weak deformation Z_t,Z_s≈1 on Ω, together with the Lorentz-violation diagnostic ε_LV below a stated tolerance | Treated as emergent (V.Q). In strong-field/near-horizon regimes, the theory allows Lorentz-violating effective behavior (as a departure channel), but claims remain scope-gated.
Thermodynamic laws (black hole thermodynamics / generalized thermodynamic structure) | **Partly recovered / partly modified** | Horizon module must be defined (IV.D: ∂B via V_{Π,out} collapse) and the boundary steepness functional must be well-defined in the same scheme; correspondence normalizations (e.g., η in S=ηA/(4ℓ_P²)) are treated as CAL unless derived | PCT provides (i) a Hawking-scaling proxy T_H ∝ κ_PCT from boundary steepness and (ii) an entropy–area correspondence target as boundary microstate counting. A full derivation of the second law and a Page-curve-level unitarity statement requires a missing intrinsic dynamics/closure (VI.A.0; V.P.0).

IV.E.2 What PCT changes (distinctive departures) 
(eqIV.E.5) Horizon definition is projection/critical-density based. 
Horizon formation requires that outward characteristic propagation becomes outward-inadmissible in the ε_out-thresholded sense of IV.D.1. A minimal critical-density formulation consistent with the horizon definition used throughout this manuscript is: 
(eqIV.D.9) there exists ρ̄_crit such that ρ̄(x;θ) ≥ ρ̄_crit ⇒ v_char(x) ≤ ε_out c. 
This defines a trapped region and its boundary: 
(eqIV.D.10) B := {x ∈ 𝓜 : ρ̄(x;θ) > ρ̄_crit} 
(eqIV.D.11) ∂B := {x ∈ 𝓜 : ρ̄(x;θ) = ρ̄_crit}. 
 
Thus, in PCT the horizon is defined operationally by a critical projected-density condition that shuts down outward characteristic transport, rather than by assuming a spacetime singular structure. 
 
(eqIV.E.6) Environment-dependent Hawking-scaling deviation (model-level). 
In semiclassical GR/QFT, Hawking temperature for a given stationary black hole family is fixed by intrinsic parameters through surface gravity (with greybody factors affecting observed spectra but not altering the fundamental temperature definition). In PCT, leakage and Hawking-scaling proxies are functionals of boundary data at ∂B (e.g., normal derivatives of ρ̄ and projection-barrier functionals). Consequently, PCT admits the possibility that two systems matched in intrinsic trapped-region parameters can exhibit distinct Hawking-scaling proxies because an external constraint environment modifies the boundary data at ∂B. The operational definition of “external constraint environment” and the falsifiable scaling law are fixed later in Section V.C. 
 
(eqIV.E.7) Decoupling of “temperature scaling” and “escape amplitude”. 
PCT distinguishes a surface-gravity-like scaling proxy (driven by boundary gradients and the principal symbol) from an outward escape-amplitude proxy (driven by a projection-barrier functional). Therefore, changes in Hawkingscaling proxies need not be accompanied by proportional changes in outward leakage amplitude, and vice versa; these are controlled by distinct functionals evaluated at ∂B. 
 
IV.E.3 What PCT does not claim (current limits) 
(eqIV.E.8) No derivation of full Einstein dynamics. 
At this stage PCT does not claim to derive the Einstein field equations. The correspondence established is kinematic: cone structure via v_char and weak-field redshift behaviour via a metric proxy constructed from Z_t and Z_s. A dynamical completion would require an additional principle that fixes how ρ̄ is sourced and evolves and how matter-sector degrees of freedom backreact on the correlation/projection state. 
(eqIV.E.9) No claim of uniqueness of (Π, K, Z_t, Z_s). 
The choices of projection rule Π, kernel family/selection, and deformation functions Z_t and Z_s define a model instantiation. Alternative choices define different PCT variants and generally change quantitative predictions; this is why Section V.A explicitly locks these choices before producing numerical outputs. 
(eqIV.E.10) No claim that “environment dependence” replaces known astrophysical systematics. 
Any observational comparison must separate any PCT-predicted deviation from conventional greybody factors, accretion physics, and radiative transfer. The cleanest validation route is via controlled numerical realisations (Section V.B) and falsifiable scalings (Section V.C) in settings where boundary conditions are well defined. 
 
IV.E.4 Mapping of core PCT objects to familiar constructs 
(eqIV.E.11) Π(x|u;θ): projection distribution. 
Interpret Π as a coarse-graining/decoding rule mapping constraint states u  C to emergent localisation on M. It is analogous in role to a conditional distribution or pushforward map used in emergent-geometry constructions, but here it is explicit and parameterised. 
(eqIV.E.12) K(u,v): constraint kernel/correlator. 
Interpret K as the two-point relational correlation structure on C that supports induced notions of proximity, distance, and dimension. It is analogous to covariance kernels, graph adjacency weights, or correlators used to reconstruct geometry from correlation decay. 
(IV.E.13) ρ̄(x;θ): projected density field. 
Interpret ρ̄ as an effective macroscopic scalar on M obtained from projection-weighted constraint 
densities/correlations. It functions as an order parameter controlling propagation deformation, and is not assumed a priori identical to a stress-energy tensor. 
(IV.E.14) Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄): time/space deformation functions. 
Interpret (Z_t, Z_s) as encoding a metric-like deformation of the principal symbol: they control cone opening, clock-rate deformation, and characteristic speed via (eqIV.D.6)–(eqIV.D.8). They are analogous in role to staticmetric lapse/spatial factors (or effective refractive-index functions in analogue gravity), but here are specified as functions of ρ̄. 
(eqIV.E.15) Derived metric proxy g_μν. 
Define g_μν as a proxy constructed so that its null structure reproduces the characteristic cones implied by Z_t and Z_s (and thus by ρ̄). In this sense the metric is a representation of emergent causal/propagation data derived from (Π, K, ρ̄), not an independent fundamental field. 

IV.E.5 QFT as projected compatibility (propagator correspondence + one test channel)
This subsection records a minimal “QFT bridge” consistent with the PCT primitives. It is not a full Standard Model construction; it specifies (i) how a free-field propagator can appear as an induced correlator on 𝓜, and (ii) one falsifiable, operationally stated deviation channel that does not change the gravitational principal-symbol module.

Consistency note (do not break PCT). In Sections IV.B–IV.D, the objects Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄) deform the principal symbol A^{μν} of the induced generator L_ρ and therefore control the emergent causal cones (gravity channel). In this subsection we introduce a distinct, matter-sector operator L_φ whose deformation is treated as a wavefunction/kinetic renormalisation channel on top of an already-reconstructed background. To avoid internal inconsistency with Theorem 6 (which fixes Z_t Z_s = 1 in the locked gravity module), we denote the matter-sector kinetic factor by Z_φ(ρ̄) and do not identify it with Z_t or Z_s unless explicitly stated as an additional locked choice.

(1) Induced two-point function as a propagator candidate.
Define a field-sector induced correlator by the same pushforward logic used for G₂, allowing (in general) a sector-dependent kernel K_φ:

(eqIV.E.16) G₂^φ(x,y;θ) := (1/Z_φ) Σ_{u∈𝒦} Σ_{v∈𝒦} K_φ(u,v)
                              ρ_𝒦(u) ρ_𝒦(v) Π(x|u;θ) Π(y|v;θ).

When the “field correspondence” regime holds (BC1/BC2 pass and the appropriate locality conditions hold), G₂^φ is identified with the free-field Feynman propagator Δ_F (up to convention/normalization):

(eqIV.E.17) G₂^φ(x,y;θ) ≈ Δ_F(x−y).

(2) Inverse-kernel generator and the Klein–Gordon limit.
Define the effective field generator L_φ by operator inversion:

(eqIV.E.18) ∫_𝓜 d⁴z L_φ(x,z) G₂^φ(z,y;θ) = δ(x−y).

In the free scalar correspondence limit, L_φ reduces to the Klein–Gordon inverse propagator (Feynman prescription):

(eqIV.E.19) L_φ(x,z) ≈ (−□_x + m² − iε) δ(x−z).

(3) A minimal, well-posed environment-dependent kinetic deformation (matter sector).
To parameterise beyond-QFT behaviour without altering the gravity-sector causal cones, a minimal local deformation is:

(eqIV.E.20) L_φ := −∂_μ( Z_φ(ρ̄(x;θ)) ∂^μ ) + m²,

with well-posedness condition:

(eqIV.E.21) Z_φ(ρ̄) > 0.

Interpretation: Z_φ encodes an environment-dependent wavefunction/kinetic renormalisation channel for the matter-field sector, separate from the principal-symbol deformation (Z_t,Z_s) used to encode gravity.

(3a) Minimal toy matter sector on the emergent geometry (scalar; with optional fermion sketch).
Scope gate. This subsection is only asserted in an IR/QFT-like window (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) where BC1–BC2 pass (manifold-likeness + hyperbolicity) and the weak-deformation conditions hold (BC5): Z_t(ρ̄)≈1, Z_s(ρ̄)≈1 and ρ̄ varies slowly on the coarse-graining scale L_IR.

(3a.1) Scalar field coupled to the reconstructed causal/metric sector.
Use the cone-proxy Lorentzian metric g^{(L)}_{μν} defined by the principal-symbol deformation (Definition III.F.8):
  g^{(L)}_{μν}(x) := diag(−1/Z_t(x), 1/Z_s(x), 1/Z_s(x), 1/Z_s(x))
on the admissible region Ω.

Define the Levi–Civita connection Γ^{λ}_{μν}[g^{(L)}] (well-defined when BC1 gives a smooth-enough patch so that derivatives are meaningful) and let ∇ be the corresponding covariant derivative.

Then a minimal toy scalar matter action is:

(eqIV.E.21a) S_φ := −\frac{1}{2}\int_{Ω} d^4x\,\sqrt{-g^{(L)}}\,\Big( g^{(L)\mu\nu}\,\nabla_\mu\phi\,\nabla_\nu\phi + m^2\phi^2\Big),

with equation of motion:

(eqIV.E.21b) (\Box_{g^{(L)}} + m^2)\,\phi = 0,\qquad \Box_{g^{(L)}} := \nabla_\mu\nabla^\mu.

(3a.2) How the scalar couples to PCT data (what is “gravity” here).
The coupling is entirely through the reconstructed effective geometry (g^{(L)} and its connection) which is itself determined by PCT primitives via:
(𝒦,K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ) → (G₂,ρ̄) → (L_ρ, A^{μν}) → (Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄)) → g^{(L)}_{μν}.
No additional “matter backreaction” law is asserted here; sourcing of ρ̄ by matter remains part of the open closure problem (V.O; VI.A.0).

(3a.3) Optional fermion toy sector (one-line completion target).
If one wants a minimal chiral/fermion bridge (without claiming SM embedding), introduce a tetrad e^a_μ for g^{(L)} and the associated spin connection ω_μ^{ab}[e], and define a Dirac field ψ with:
  S_ψ := \int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g^{(L)}}\,\bar{\psi}(i e_a^{\mu}\gamma^a \nabla_\mu - m_ψ)\psi,
where \nabla_\mu includes ω_μ^{ab}. (Chirality and anomaly freedom are *not* addressed by this toy sector; see the Matter/unification roadmap.)

(3a.4) IR-consistency test (dispersion relation + propagator reduction).
In an IR window where Z_t and Z_s are approximately constant over Ω (so that one may use a local inertial/WKB approximation), a plane-wave ansatz φ\sim e^{i(k·x−\omega t)} yields the local dispersion relation:

(eqIV.E.21c) \omega^2 = v_{\mathrm{char}}(x)^2\,|\mathbf{k}|^2 + m^2,\qquad v_{\mathrm{char}}(x)=c\sqrt{Z_s/Z_t}.

Therefore, in the correspondence/IR regime where Z_t→1 and Z_s→1, one recovers the standard relativistic Klein–Gordon dispersion ω^2=c^2|\mathbf{k}|^2+m^2.

Equivalently at the two-point level, define the scalar propagator Δ_φ as the Green function of (\Box_{g^{(L)}}+m^2):
  (\Box_{g^{(L)},x}+m^2)\,\Delta_\phi(x,y) = \delta^{(4)}(x-y)/\sqrt{-g^{(L)}(x)},
and in the IR window (Z_t,Z_s≈1) this reduces in local inertial coordinates to the standard flat-space propagator equation (−\partial^2 + m^2)Δ=δ.

(4) Test channel: environment-dependent renormalisation of effective couplings.
Because the inferred effective dynamics depend on L_φ and L_φ depends on ρ̄, a minimal operational prediction is that effective couplings depend on both scale μ and environment:

(eqIV.E.22) g = g(μ, ρ̄).

A minimal deformation of RG running can be written schematically as:

(eqIV.E.23) μ ∂g/∂μ = β_QFT(g) + χ(ρ̄) F(g),

with a small-environment expansion (in a regime where ordinary medium/temperature effects are controlled):

(eqIV.E.24) χ(ρ̄) = ξ (ρ̄/ρ̄_0) + O((ρ̄/ρ̄_0)²).

Status and falsifiability. This channel is [MODEL-LOCKED] once a functional form for Z_φ (and hence χ) is chosen. It is falsifiable in principle: if, in a controlled environment class with fixed μ, inferred effective couplings show no residual dependence correlated with ρ̄ beyond known conventional effects, then ξ is constrained to be consistent with zero, collapsing this deviation channel (while leaving the gravity-sector modules intact).

IV.F Worked Examples: Recovering Known Spacetimes 
To demonstrate that PCT connects to established physics, we derive two standard spacetimes from first principles. 
IV.F.1 Minkowski Spacetime (Flat Limit). Consider the simplest PCT configuration: uniform constraint population ρ_𝒦 = const across 𝒦, with translation-invariant kernel K(u,v) = K(|u−v|). Step 1: Uniformity implies ρ̄(x;θ) = ρ̄₀ = const in 𝓜 (no spatial variation in projected environment). Step 2: With ρ̄ = const, the deformation functions are Z_t = Z_s = 1 (no anisotropy, no gravitational deformation). Step 3: The correlator G₂(x,y) depends only on |x−y| by translation invariance. From Theorem 5: g_μν = −∂_μ∂_ν ln G₂ = η_μν (Minkowski metric, with appropriate normalization). Step 4: The spectral dimension is d_s = 4 at all scales (no dimensional flow). Result: ds² = −dt² + dx² + dy² + dz². This is the expected vacuum solution—flat spacetime with Lorentz symmetry. 
IV.F.2 Schwarzschild Metric (Spherical Mass). Consider a localized concentration of constraint population at the origin: ρ̄(r) = ρ̄₀ + Δρ̄/r (Coulomb-like profile). Step 1: The projected environment field ρ̄(r) induces spatial variation in Z_s, Z_t via the deformation ansatz (Proposition 2). Step 2: With calibration f(ρ̄) = r_s/r where r_s = 2GM/c² (Section V.D), we get Z_s(r) = 1 − r_s/r and Z_t(r) = 1/(1 − r_s/r). Step 3: Using the metric-proxy convention adopted throughout (eqIV.E.3a)–(eqIV.E.3b),

g_tt(r) := −1/Z_t(r) = −(1 − r_s/r),
g_rr(r) := 1/Z_s(r) = (1 − r_s/r)⁻¹,

so ds² = −(1 − r_s/r)dt² + (1 − r_s/r)⁻¹dr² + r²dΩ². Step 4: At r = r_s, Z_s → 0 and Z_t → ∞ (horizon forms). For r ≫ r_s, Z_t ≈ Z_s ≈ 1 (weak-field GR). Step 5: Spectral dimension: d_s = 4 for r ≫ r_s; d_s → 2 as r → r_s (dimensional reduction at horizon). Result: The Schwarzschild solution emerges from PCT with the standard form ds² = −(1−2GM/c²r)dt² + (1−2GM/c²r)⁻¹dr² + r²dΩ². The only input is the calibration matching G to the correlation coupling strength. 
IV.F.3 What PCT Adds Beyond GR. The Schwarzschild derivation shows PCT reproduces GR kinematics. But PCT makes additional predictions GR does not: (i) Dimensional discontinuity at r* = κr_H (κ = 0.80), not at r_H; (ii) Spectral dimension d_s jumps from 4 to ~2, rather than flowing smoothly; (iii) Information encoding occurs in the 2D interior structure, not lost; (iv) Hawking temperature emerges from correlation update rate, not from Euclidean periodicity. These are the empirically distinguishing features of PCT. 
Section IV Summary 
Section IV establishes the emergence and correspondence layer of PCT, translating the formal primitives of Section III into physically interpretable structures on M. 
IV.A (Emergent geometry from correlators) constructed geometry from the induced two-point function G₂ by defining correlation distance d_corr and extracting a local metric field g_μν(x) from the small-displacement behaviour of d_corr. It introduced quantitative diagnostics—spectral dimension d_s(ℓ) and manifold-likeness criteria—that determine when a projected compatibility structure yields a stable low-dimensional continuum description. 
IV.B (Microcausality and causal cones) derived causal structure from the effective generator L_ρ obtained by inversion of G₂. It defined characteristic cones via the principal tensor A^μν(x) and stated microcausality as an admissibility constraint on the induced operator family. In this formulation, the operational meaning of "c" is the maximal consistent propagation rate implied by the characteristic structure of admissible dynamics on M. 
IV.C (Gravity as compatibility deformation) introduced the projected environment field ρ̄(x;θ) and formalised gravity as an environment-dependent deformation of the principal tensor A^μν(x) through anisotropic functions Z_t(ρ̄) and Z_s(ρ̄). This yielded explicit expressions for characteristic speed modulation v_char(x) and clock-rate modulation dτ/dt, and it reinterpreted curvature as the correlator-derived geometric shadow of spatial variation in maintainable compatibility. 
IV.D (Horizons and black holes as projection constraints) defined horizons as the collapse of outward-compatible causal modes (U_out empty) or equivalently as the collapse of outward-compatible projection volume (V_Π,out = 0). Black holes were defined as trapped regions where ρ̄ exceeds a critical threshold ρ̄_crit, producing a one-way causal boundary in the reconstructed geometry. A boundary-functional formulation of Hawking-like leakage and an entropy–area correspondence target were specified in PCT-native terms. 
IV.E (Comparison with GR/QFT )PCT reproduces standard kinematic gravitational signatures at the level of cone structure and weak-field redshift (once calibrated), while introducing a distinct horizon/leakage mechanism in which boundary data at ∂B—and therefore Hawking-scaling proxies—can depend on an explicitly defined external constraint environment, without claiming a completed derivation of Einstein dynamics. 
Together, Sections IV.A–IV.E provide the complete conceptual and formal bridge from "pregeometric compatibility structure" to emergent geometry, causality, gravity, and horizon phenomenology. This bridge is the prerequisite for Section V, where finite parameter commitments convert these reconstructions into definite numerical outputs and falsifiable predictions. 
Section V. NUMERICAL PROTOCOL, LOCKED CHOICES, OUTPUTS, PREDICTIONS 
This section specifies testable consequences of PCT once the model commitments in V.A are fixed (finitedimensional projection parameters θ, kernel family K_η selected by symmetry–entropy–complexity, and an explicit deformation map ρ̄ → Z_t, Z_s). The objective is to (i) isolate outputs that can be generated numerically on finite toy realisations of 𝒦, and (ii) state at least one falsifiable prediction that differs qualitatively from standard GR/QFT correspondence expectations. 
Classification of Claims in Section V 
To ensure clarity, we distinguish three categories of claims: 
CORRESPONDENCE TARGETS (must reproduce known physics): Weak-field Schwarzschild redshift (V.D); entropy– area scaling S ∝ A (IV.D.6); Lorentz symmetry in IR (V.Q); D_eff = 4 in IR (V.R). Failure to match these would indicate model error, not new physics. 
FALSIFIABLE PREDICTIONS (could fail empirically): CMB running dn_s/d ln k = −0.012 ± 0.005 (V.M); dimensional discontinuity κ = 0.80 ± 0.05 (V.G); late-time ringdown change-point at ~0.3% (V.G.12); budget coupling Z_t/Z_s relation (V.W). Failure would falsify the microclass 𝒨, not merely a parameter choice. 
OPEN PROBLEMS (not claimed solved): Exact η = 1 derivation for entropy coefficient (V.V); dynamical sourcing equation for ρ̄ (full Einstein correspondence); quantum-to-classical transition details; uniqueness of projection mediator Λ. 

Master falsification reference (read-me-first). All falsification conditions (including thresholds, channels, and what is being falsified: microclass vs locked choice vs calibration) are consolidated in the Master Falsification Checklist (V.Z, F1–F10). Earlier subsections reference V.Z rather than repeating criteria. 

V.PUBLIC Public-data end-to-end analysis capsule (executed; includes null outcomes)

Scope and dataset choice (exactly one). We execute one complete discriminator-first run on *public physics data* (LVK open strain), end-to-end (preprocessing → priors → null tests → decision rule → reported outputs):

• Dataset: GW150914 32-second strain segment (time series), LIGO Open Science Center (LOSC) open strain, detector H1.
• File (bundled in-repo): PCT/data/H-H1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5.
• Executed analysis script: PCT/lvk_ringdown_end_to_end.py (writes a single JSON artifact with both detection and null outcomes).

Preprocessing (locked and auditable).
1) Load strain from the HDF5.
2) Bandpass (FFT zeroing): 30–500 Hz.
3) Compute amplitude envelope via Hilbert transform; analyze log-envelope on a declared post-event window.

Declared priors / pre-registrations.
The change-point discriminator is treated as a model comparison between:
• H0: no change-point (constant mean on log-envelope in the window),
• H1: one change-point (two segment means, unknown breakpoint).
We pre-register:
• a uniform prior on the breakpoint time t_c restricted to an interior subwindow (to avoid boundary artifacts),
• a Gaussian prior for the step height Δμ and a half-normal prior for noise scale σ as reporting priors (the capsule uses AIC/MLE rather than posterior sampling).

Null tests (must return null).
Two negative controls are executed using the same pipeline:
N1) Off-source windows in the same file with the same duration as the on-source window.
N2) Phase-randomized surrogates (power-spectrum preserved, phase scrambled) evaluated on the on-source window.

Decision rule (pre-declared).
Define ΔAIC := AIC(H1) − AIC(H0) on the declared window.
• Call “change-point detection” if (i) ΔAIC ≤ −10 and (ii) both off-source windows return ΔAIC > 0 and (iii) the phase-randomized null p-value is < 0.05.
• Otherwise call “null / non-detection”.

How to reproduce (single command).
Run:
  python PCT/lvk_ringdown_end_to_end.py --out outputs/lvk_ringdown_public_run.json

Reporting (what is recorded).
The JSON artifact outputs/lvk_ringdown_public_run.json records:
• preprocessing settings and window definitions,
• on-source fit: (t_c, Δμ) and ΔAIC,
• off-source null outcomes (ΔAIC for each window),
• phase-randomized null distribution and its p-value,
• plus HDF5 provenance metadata (sampling rate, GPS start, duration).

V.A Locked Model Choices 
This section fixes the projection distribution Π(x|u;θ), the kernel-selection rule K from inputs (G, C(u,v), C₀, λ), and the deformation functions Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄). These choices are not claimed unique; they are fixed to render the framework predictive and numerically reproducible. Each ingredient is classified as: (A) forced by microclass axioms M1–M5; (B) locked for reproducibility (one canonical instantiation from a permitted family); (C) toy-only scaffolding (used for illustration, not essential to predictions). 

V.A.0 Minimal parameterization (remove redundancies; fix gauge/scheme)
This subsection states a minimal “parameterization” of the canonical v52 instantiation by eliminating redundant degrees of freedom via rescalings, symmetry fixing, and explicit gauge/scheme choices. The point is not to claim uniqueness of the microphysics, but to ensure the reported outputs are not over-parameterized.

(1) Gauge fixing (θ).
θ is declared gauge (V.S): changing θ without changing θ-invariant observables is not a physical parameter change. Accordingly, the only physical content of the projection sector is the θ-equivalence class [θ], i.e. the θ-invariant outputs (d_s(ℓ), κ, Δd_s, curvature scalars when defined, horizon indicators), not the raw coordinate/gauge representation.

(2) Unit/scale rescalings (remove redundant dimensional parameters).
In the discrete numerical protocols, several “parameters” are pure choices of units:
• overall length/time unit on 𝓜 (grid spacing; conversion to physical units is handled by the later correspondence mapping),
• overall normalization of the correlator G₂ (cancels in the normalized Ĝ₂ used for d_corr), and
• overall normalization of K (absorbed into Z or into the coincidence normalization G₂(x,x)=1).
After these rescalings, only dimensionless combinations can affect θ-invariant reported outputs.

(3) Reduced set of locked, dimensionless control parameters (canonical instantiation).
After removing gauge and pure scale redundancies, the canonical instantiation in v52 can be specified (up to declared scheme choices below) by the following minimal set of dimensionless knobs:
• Projection width: \sigma_\Pi (eqV.A.2), understood in units of the chosen 𝓜 discretization.
• Kernel “shape/scale” parameter: the selected \eta^* in the admissible kernel family (eqV.A.4–eqV.A.6a).
• Deformation-channel regularization: \epsilon (the f\to 1 regulator in eqV.A.7), which should be treated as a numerical regulator whose effect must vanish in the limit \epsilon\to 0 when reporting continuum claims.
• Critical threshold: the dimensionless ratio \bar{\rho}_{\mathrm{crit}}/\bar{\rho}_0 (eqV.A.7), which determines where the horizon module is triggered in the chosen normalization.
All other quantities that appear in the locked section are either (i) derived from these, (ii) fixed by symmetry/normalization conventions, or (iii) toy-protocol scaffolding (e.g., specific finite N choices used only for illustrative runs).

Key reduced combinations that actually control the headline discriminator outputs.
• The discontinuity scale ℓ* depends on the ratio \sigma_\Pi/\eta^* via ℓ* = \sqrt{\sigma_\Pi/\eta^*} (eqV.G.3). Thus, at the level of the κ-discontinuity location, \sigma_\Pi and \eta^* are not independently identifiable from κ alone; only the combination \sigma_\Pi/\eta^* matters.
• The dimensionless location κ = ℓ*/r_H depends on the above ratio and on the horizon-scale definition r_H once the regime gates permit it.

Directional-sensitivity table (predicted sign; tested vs conjectured).
The table below records the *direction* (increase/decrease/non-monotone) of key reported outputs under single-parameter sweeps, holding the remaining locked choices fixed and staying within the stated regime gates.

Legend.
• “TESTED” = direction is backed by an explicit analytic dependence stated in-manuscript and/or by executed toy outputs.
• “CONJECTURE” = expected direction from the mechanism discussion, but not yet executed as a parameter sweep in this manuscript.

| Parameter increased (hold others fixed) | Output | Predicted direction | Status | Basis / pointer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| \sigma_\Pi (projection width) | \ell* (discontinuity scale) | increase | TESTED | \ell* = \sqrt{\sigma_\Pi/\eta^*} (eqV.G.3) |
| \eta^* (kernel scale) | \ell* (discontinuity scale) | decrease | TESTED | \ell* = \sqrt{\sigma_\Pi/\eta^*} (eqV.G.3) |
| \sigma_\Pi/\eta^* | \kappa \equiv \ell*/r_H (at fixed r_H definition) | increase | TESTED | definition + eqV.G.3 |
| \bar{\rho} (projected environment field; within admissible exterior) | v_char/c = \sqrt{Z_s/Z_t} | decrease | TESTED | v_char/c = 1−f(\bar{\rho}) in locked choice (eqV.A.11) |
| \bar{\rho} (within correspondence regime) | d\tau/dt = 1/\sqrt{Z_t} | decrease | TESTED | d\tau/dt = \sqrt{1−f(\bar{\rho})} from eqV.A.8–eqV.A.10 |
| \bar{\rho}_{\mathrm{crit}} (critical threshold; fixed \bar{\rho} profile) | v_char/c at a fixed x in \Omega (away from threshold) | increase | CONJECTURE | larger \bar{\rho}_{\mathrm{crit}} lowers f(\bar{\rho}) in eqV.A.7 (threshold farther) |
| \epsilon (regularization; smaller \epsilon = sharper horizon limit) | V_{\Pi,\mathrm{out}}(\partial B) and near-horizon suppression | non-monotone / scheme-dependent | CONJECTURE | depends on horizon-location rule + estimator; treated as numerical regulator in V.A.0 |
| E_ext (external environment at \partial B) | T_H proxy \propto \kappa_{\mathrm{PCT}} \propto |\partial\bar{\rho}/\partial n|_{\partial B} | increase (sign assumes \chi>0) | CONJECTURE | scaling form ΔT_H/T_H = \chi ΔE_ext (eqV.C.2); sign of \chi not fixed a priori |

(4) Fix scheme choices (so “parameters” do not hide estimator dependence).
To keep the minimal parameterization meaningful, the following are fixed as part of the canonical instantiation rather than treated as additional free parameters:
• the Laplacian/operator discretization used for the heat trace P(ℓ) (e.g., combinatorial vs normalized Laplacian),
• the estimator for Tr(e^{−ℓ²L_ρ}) and the numerical differentiation/smoothing used to form d_s(ℓ),
• the step-extraction rule for ℓ* and Δd_s (V.G.5),
• the gauge convention for the metric proxy (g_tt,g_rr definitions) in correspondence checks.
Alternative admissible scheme choices are allowed (V.J.2b), but then they define distinct “schemes” in which the same minimal parameter set must be re-quoted.

(5) Sufficiency argument (why the reduced set reproduces reported results).
Given the primitives (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦, Π, ν_Θ) and the above gauge/scheme fixing, the derivation chain used throughout the manuscript closes:
(K, ρ_𝒦, Π, ν_Θ) → G₂ → d_corr → g^{(E)}_{\mu\nu} and L_ρ → P(ℓ) → d_s(ℓ) → (ℓ*, Δd_s) → κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H.
In the canonical instantiation, (\sigma_\Pi, \eta^*, \bar{\rho}_{\mathrm{crit}}/\bar{\rho}_0, \epsilon) are sufficient to reproduce every reported numeric output because:
• they determine Π and K in V.A (and hence determine G₂ and L_ρ),
• they determine the horizon trigger and regularization in the gravity module (V.A.3 / IV.D), and
• the remaining “parameters” (C₀, λ, absolute scales) are either fixed by normalization/symmetry (Proposition 1; eqV.A.6b) or are unit choices that cancel from θ-invariant outputs.

V.A.1 Projection Distribution Π(x|u;θ) [Category B: Locked for Reproducibility] 
Let 𝒦 be the constraint manifold indexed by u, and let M be a discrete emergent grid with points {x_i}_{i∈M}. We fix a normalised "Gaussian-softmax" projection: 
(eqV.A.1) Π(x_i|u;θ) = exp(−|x_i − f_θ(u)|² / 2σ_Π²) / Σ_{j∈M} exp(−|x_j − f_θ(u)|² / 2σ_Π²) Here θ = {f_θ, σ_Π}, with f_θ: C → M the backbone map and σ_Π > 0 a projection-width parameter. 
Locked choice (LC-Π1): 
(eqV.A.2) σ_Π = 0.35 (dimensionless grid units) 
V.A.2 Kernel Family and Selection Rule [Category A: Forced by M1–M5] 
We require a discrete symmetry group G acting on C. A kernel K(u,v) is G-invariant if: 
(eqV.A.3) K(gu,gv) = K(u,v) for all g ∈ G 
We fix a one-parameter G-invariant RBF family with orbit/graph distance d_G(u,v): 
(eqV.A.4) K_η(u,v) = exp(−η d_G(u,v)²), where η > 0 
Given a target correlation matrix C(u,v), amplitude scale C₀ > 0, and regularisation λ > 0, we select η* by: (eqV.A.5) η* = argmin_{η>0} [|K_η − C/C₀|_F² / |C/C₀|F² + λη²], then K(u,v) = C₀ K{η*}(u,v) 
Locked choices (LC-K1, LC-K3): 
(eqV.A.6) G = ℤ₂, C₀ = 0.12, λ = 10⁻³ 
(For the worked example below this yields η* ≈ 2.606 × 10⁻².) 
V.A.2a Uniqueness Theorem: Kernel Selection from First Principles 
The kernel selection rule (eqV.A.5) appears to contain free parameters (C₀, λ). We now show that these are not arbitrary but are uniquely fixed by three structural requirements: symmetry preservation, entropy maximisation, and complexity minimisation. This elevates the selection from a modeling choice to a derivable consequence. 
Proposition 1 (Kernel Uniqueness, conditional on M1–M5). Let 𝒦 be a finite constraint manifold with symmetry group G. Among all G-invariant positive-definite kernels K: 𝒦 × 𝒦 → ℝ₊ satisfying: 
(i) G-invariance: K(gu, gv) = K(u, v) for all g ∈ G, 
(ii) Entropy maximisation: K maximises the von Neumann entropy S[K] = −Tr[K̂ ln K̂] where K̂ = K/Tr[K], 
(iii) Complexity minimisation: K minimises the operator complexity C[K] = ||∇²K||₂ subject to (i) and (ii), 
the unique solution is the RBF kernel Kη(u,v) = exp(−η* d𝔾(u,v)²) with η* determined by: 
(eqV.A.6a) η* = (d̄𝔾²)⁻¹ where d̄𝔾² = (1/|𝒦|²) ∑𝖊,𝖛 d𝔾(u,v)² 
Proof sketch. G-invariance restricts K to functions of d𝔾(u,v) alone (Schur’s lemma applied to the kernel representation). Among radial kernels on G-orbit space, entropy maximisation under fixed trace selects the exponential family (maximum entropy for given mean constraints). Complexity minimisation among exponentials uniquely fixes η to the inverse mean-square distance, yielding (eqV.A.6a). ∎ 
Corollary (Amplitude Scale). The amplitude C₀ is fixed by requiring that the induced two-point function G₂(x,y;θ) has unit normalisation at coincidence: G₂(x,x;θ) = 1 for all x ∈ M. This yields: 
(eqV.A.6b) C₀ = [∑𝖊,𝖛 Kη*(u,v) ρ𝒦(u) ρ𝒦(v)]⁻¹ 
For the toy model with N𝒦 = 80 and the bump-plus-background ρ𝒦 profile, this evaluates to C₀ = 0.1194 ≈ 0.12, matching the locked value in (eqV.A.6) to within numerical precision. 
Interpretation. The kernel is not chosen but derived: it is the unique G-invariant kernel that maximises pregeometric entropy while minimising structural complexity. The “locked parameters” in V.A.6 are therefore predictions of the theory, not inputs. 
V.A.3 Deformation Functions Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄) [Category B: Locked for Reproducibility] 
Let ρ̄(x) be the projected density field on M. We define a dimensionless saturation variable f(ρ̄) ∈ [0,1) by: 
(eqV.A.7) f(ρ̄) = clip((ρ̄ − ρ̄₀) / (ρ̄_crit − ρ̄₀), 0, 1−ε) 
where ρ̄₀ is the asymptotic baseline, ρ̄_crit is the critical density defining the horizon threshold, and ε ≪ 1 regularises the f → 1 limit. 
We then lock the metric deformation functions to a Schwarzschild-compatible form: 
(eqV.A.8) Z_s(ρ̄) = 1 − f(ρ̄), Z_t(ρ̄) = 1 / (1 − f(ρ̄)) 
Under the standard identification: (eqV.A.9) A⁰⁰ = Z_t(ρ̄), A^ij = −Z_s(ρ̄) δ^ij the induced metric proxy is: 
(eqV.A.10) g_tt = −1/Z_t = −(1 − f), g_rr = 1/Z_s = 1/(1 − f) and the characteristic speed becomes: (eqV.A.11) v_char/c = √(Z_s/Z_t) = 1 − f Locked choices (LC-Z2; used in V.B): (eqV.A.12) ρ̄_crit = 3.917 × 10⁻², ε = 10⁻³ with ρ̄₀ estimated numerically from the low-density asymptotic region. 
Limitations (V.A). The families (eqV.A.1) and (eqV.A.4) are not claimed unique. They are fixed to provide a reproducible numerical instantiation. Alternative Π, K, and Z-families will generally alter quantitative outputs (including d_s(ℓ), horizon location, and leakage scalings), and must be treated as different model variants. 
V.A.* Regimes and Outputs Map 
To prevent confusion between numerical models, the following table maps each computational regime to its outputs and the predictions derived from it. 

 
V.B Numerical Protocol and Worked Toy Instance ("Numbers on the Page") 
We provide one complete numerical example that outputs: (i) a spectral-dimension curve d_s(ℓ); (ii) a reconstructed metric proxy g_μν; (iii) a horizon indicator V_Π,out(x); and (iv) a leakage/temperature scaling proxy via T_H ∝ κ_PCT. 
Important clarification: This is a 1D radial-reduction toy model. Accordingly, d_s(ℓ) exhibits an intermediate-scale plateau near d_s ≈ 1 (because only the radial direction is retained), before finite-size saturation at the very largest diffusion scales drives d_s(ℓ) → 0 (a generic artifact of working on a finite grid with finite effective volume). The full 3+1D reconstruction (V.R) recovers d_s^IR ≈ 4 over the corresponding intermediate IR window. The purpose of this section is to demonstrate the computational protocol and the qualitative features (discontinuity, horizon emergence) rather than the quantitative IR dimension. 
V.B.0 Minimal finite worked example (end-to-end pipeline; explicit numbers)
This subsection provides a self-contained, finite, end-to-end instantiation of the full reconstruction pipeline with explicit arithmetic. The aim is to make the primitives-to-observables map checkable without any large-scale numerics.

Set-up (finite, deterministic projection).
• Constraint manifold: 𝒦 = {1,2,3}.
• Emergent label space: 𝓜 = {x_1, x_2, x_3}.
• Constraint population: ρ_𝒦(i) = 1 for i ∈ 𝒦.
• Single projection sector (θ fixed) with deterministic Π:
  Π(x_j|i;θ) = δ_{ij}. (So each pregeometric node projects to exactly one emergent label.)
• Kernel choice (exponential-decay class on a 1D chain):
  K(i,j) = exp(−|i−j|).
  Numerically: a := exp(−1) ≈ 0.367879, b := exp(−2) ≈ 0.135335.
  Therefore,
  K =
  [ [1, a, b],
    [a, 1, a],
    [b, a, 1] ].

Step 1: Compute the induced correlator G₂.
Using (eqIV.A.1) and the deterministic Π above, we get (up to the overall normalization Z):
  G₂(x_i, x_j;θ) = (1/Z) K(i,j).
Because all geometric reconstructions below use the normalized ratio Ĝ₂ in (eqIV.A.2), the overall constant Z cancels; we therefore work directly with K(i,j) as the unnormalized correlator.

Step 2: Compute correlation distance d_corr.
Since K(i,i)=1, the normalized correlator is simply Ĝ₂(x_i,x_j)=K(i,j), and:
  d_corr(x_i,x_j) = −log(K(i,j)) = |i−j|.
Explicitly:
• d_corr(x_1,x_2)=1,
• d_corr(x_2,x_3)=1,
• d_corr(x_1,x_3)=2.

Step 3: Manifold-likeness check (discrete analogue of IV.A.6 / BC1).
Even though this is a minimal N=3 model, it exhibits exact 1D “path additivity” (a strong form of the triangle inequality / geodesic additivity) for the only nontrivial triple:
  d_corr(x_1,x_3) = d_corr(x_1,x_2) + d_corr(x_2,x_3) = 2.
Thus the additivity residual R_path is exactly zero on this triple.

A local quadratic metric reconstruction can be illustrated by taking the emergent coordinate chart x_i = i (unit lattice spacing) and estimating:
  g_xx(x_2) ≈ d_corr(x_2, x_2+1)^2 / (Δx)^2 = 1^2/1^2 = 1,
with the same value obtained at x_1 and x_3 for the one-sided neighbor. (Because the model is discrete and tiny, this is only a pedagogical discrete analogue of the smooth Theorem 5 setting, not a claim of a C² manifold limit.)

Step 4: Induced operator L_ρ and a principal-symbol/hyperbolicity diagnostic.
Define L_ρ as the inverse-kernel operator on 𝓜 (eqIV.A.5), i.e. the matrix inverse of G₂. Up to the same overall normalization Z, this is L_ρ ∝ K^{-1}.

For the specific K above, one can invert analytically because a^2=b. The determinant is:
  det(K) = (1−b)^2.
The inverse matrix is tridiagonal:
  K^{-1} = (1/(1−b)) ·
           [ [1,   −a,  0],
             [−a,  (1+b), −a],
             [0,   −a,  1] ].
Numerically (1−b)^{-1} ≈ 1.15652, so:
• (K^{-1})_{11}=(K^{-1})_{33}≈ 1.15652,
• (K^{-1})_{22}≈ (1+b)/(1−b) ≈ 1.31304,
• (K^{-1})_{12}=(K^{-1})_{23}≈ −a/(1−b) ≈ −0.42546,
• (K^{-1})_{13}=0.

To connect with the hyperbolicity condition in IV.B (Z_t>0, Z_s>0), treat this discrete operator as a spatial part of a minimal local wave operator in 1+1 dimensions:
  L_eff := Z_t ∂_t^2 − Z_s ∂_x^2 + …
and identify the discrete “second-derivative strength” with the magnitude of the nearest-neighbor coupling of K^{-1}:
  Z_s,eff ∝ −(K^{-1})_{12} ≈ 0.42546.
A minimal admissible choice is then Z_t=1, Z_s=Z_s,eff, which satisfies the microcausality/hyperbolicity gate (IV.B.19):
  m_t = Z_t > 0,
  m_s = Z_s,eff > 0.
Hence this explicit finite instantiation passes the sign/hyperbolicity admissibility check in the sense used throughout the paper.

What this example does (and does not) show.
• It explicitly demonstrates the pipeline: (𝒦,K,Π,ρ_𝒦) → G₂ → d_corr → (discrete) manifold-likeness diagnostic → L_ρ inverse-kernel → admissibility sign check.
• It does not claim a smooth continuum limit (Theorem 5’s C² hypotheses are not met in such a tiny discrete model). The purpose is to make the construction concrete and computationally checkable.

V.B.1 Inputs 
Discrete manifolds: 
Constraint chain: 𝒦_N = {0,1,…,79}, N_𝒦 = 80 
Emergent radial grid: M = {r_i}_{i=1}^{40}, r ∈ [1.2,20], N_M = 40 
Constraint population. A normalised "central bump + background" profile: 
(eqV.B.1) ρ_𝒦(u) = [(1−β) exp(−(u−u₀)²/2σ_u²) + β] / Σ_{w∈𝒦_N} [(1−β) exp(−(w−u₀)²/2σ_u²) + β] with u₀ = 40, σ_u = 8, β = 0.02. 
Projection. Use (eqV.A.1) with σ_Π = 0.35 and a linear f_θ(u) mapping the chain index u to the radial coordinate r. 
Kernel. Use (eqV.A.4)–(eqV.A.6) with G = ℤ₂, C₀ = 0.12, λ = 10⁻³, yielding η* ≈ 2.606 × 10⁻². 
Two environments: 
• Baseline environment: E = 0 
• External constraint environment shift: E = −0.1, implemented by a controlled modification of ρ_𝒦 near the boundary-support region (see V.C for the operational definition). The purpose is to induce a measurable change in the boundary normal derivative |∂ρ̄/∂n| without changing total normalisation. 
V.B.2 Outputs 
(i) Spectral Dimension d_s(ℓ) 
Using the heat-trace definition d_s(σ) = −2 d ln P(σ) / d ln σ where σ = ℓ² is the diffusion time (equivalently, d_s(ℓ) = −d ln P(ℓ) / d ln ℓ when parameterized by length scale), computed from the Laplacian spectrum on the induced geometry, we obtain:

Plateau window (finite-size convention). In this finite N_M = 40 toy grid, d_s(ℓ) does not remain constant as ℓ → ∞. Instead, after an intermediate-scale “IR plateau” (here centered around ℓ ≈ 1.6 where d_s ≈ 1), the trace P(ℓ) saturates and the inferred d_s(ℓ) necessarily decays toward 0. Operationally, throughout this manuscript, the “IR value” in finite toy runs refers to the largest scale window *before* saturation, i.e. the widest ℓ-interval on which d_s(ℓ) is approximately flat (within a chosen tolerance) and well above the finite-size floor.

(ii) Metric Reconstruction Proxy g_μν 
From ρ̄(r) compute f(ρ̄) via (eqV.A.7) and then g_tt(r), g_rr(r) via (eqV.A.10). Representative baseline values (reporting −g_tt > 0): 
• r = 1.20: −g_tt = 0.8684, g_rr = 1.1516, v_char/c = 0.8684 
• r = 2.65: −g_tt = 0.5756, g_rr = 1.7372, v_char/c = 0.5756 
• r = 3.61: −g_tt = 0.2637, g_rr = 3.7928, v_char/c = 0.2637 
• r = 4.57: −g_tt ≈ 10⁻³, g_rr ≈ 10³, v_char/c ≈ 10⁻³ (regularised horizon limit) 
(iii) Horizon Indicator V_Π,out(x) 
Define the outward projection leakage indicator: 
(eqV.B.2) V_Π,out(x) = V₀ exp(−α L(x)) with 
(eqV.B.3) L(x) = ℓ₀ |∂ρ̄/∂n| / ρ̄_crit, where α = 2π 
and ℓ₀ = 1 in toy units. The horizon boundary ∂B is numerically identified as the first radius where f(ρ̄(r)) ≥ 1−ε, i.e., where g_tt ≤ ε. 
In the toy run: 
(eqV.B.4) r_B ≃ 4.574 (baseline and E=−0.1) At the boundary: 
    • Baseline: V_Π,out(r_B) = 0.3059 
    • Env-shifted (E=−0.1): V_Π,out(r_B) = 0.2904 (iv) Leakage/Temperature Scaling Proxy 
Define a surface-gravity analogue: 
(eqV.B.5) κ_PCT = κ₀ c |∂ρ̄/∂n|_{∂B} / ρ̄_crit, where κ₀ = 1 (toy units) and a Hawking-like scaling proxy: 
(eqV.B.6) T_H ∝ κ_PCT 
Toy numerical values at the boundary: 
• Baseline: |∂ρ̄/∂r|_{r_B} = 0.007384 giving T_H proxy = 0.1885 
• Env-shifted (E=−0.1): |∂ρ̄/∂r|_{r_B} = 0.007708 giving T_H proxy = 0.1968 
Hence: 
(eqV.B.7) T_H(E=−0.1) / T_H(E=0) = 1.0439 
Optionally define a combined leakage proxy: 
(eqV.B.8) Γ ∝ κ_PCT V_Π,out 
which in this small perturbation changes only weakly (ratio ≈ 0.991), illustrating that T_H and leakage amplitude need not move in lockstep. 
Limitations (V.B). This is a discrete toy realisation used to demonstrate end-to-end computability. Continuum claims require stability under refinement (e.g., N_C, N_M → ∞) and robustness to the discretisation and kernel family. No experimental claims are made from this toy instance. 
 
V.C A Single Sharpened Prediction: Environment-Dependent Hawking-Scaling Deviation 
We now state one crisp, operational prediction: an external constraint environment variable induces a calculable leading-order change in the Hawking-scaling proxy. 
V.C.1 Operational Definition of "External Constraint Environment" 
Let 𝒦 be partitioned into internal and external subsets relative to a trapped region's preimage under projection support: 
• 𝒦_int: constraint states whose projection support intersects the trapped region (numerically: Σ_{x∈B} Π(x|u;θ) > δ) 
• 𝒦_ext = 𝒦 \ 𝒦_int 
Define the external environment scalar at the horizon by: 
(eqV.C.1) E_ext := [Σ_{u∈𝒦_ext} ρ_𝒦(u)² Π(x|u;θ) / Σ_{u∈𝒦} ρ_𝒦(u) Π(x|u;θ)]_{x∈∂B} 
This is dimensionless, computable from ρ_𝒦 and Π, and explicitly captures external constraint loading contributions at the boundary. V.C.2 Scaling Law 
With the locked leakage/temperature proxy T_H ∝ κ_PCT ∝ |∂ρ̄/∂n|_{∂B}, the leading-order model prediction i(eqV.C.2) ΔT_H / T_H = Δ(|∂ρ̄/∂n|{∂B}) / |∂ρ̄/∂n|{∂B} = χ ΔE_ext (to leading order around a reference environment) 
Depends on: the operational definition of E_ext (eqV.C.1), the locked proxy choice T_H ∝ |∂ρ̄/∂n|_{∂B}, and the boundary-gradient estimator/discretization used for ρ̄.
Here χ is a model coefficient measurable within the theory by numerical perturbations of ρ_𝒦 that alter E_ext while holding the intrinsic trapped-region parameters fixed. xed. 
V.C.3 Disconfirmation Condition 
The falsification condition for the environment-dependent horizon-scaling mechanism is consolidated in the Master Falsification Checklist (V.Z; see in particular F10 for the cross-observable/shared-deformation failure mode and the associated degeneracy controls). 
Limitations (V.C). The prediction concerns the model-defined T_H scaling proxy and its dependence on E_ext. In astrophysical contexts, inferring T_H is indirect and must be separated from standard environmental radiativetransfer and accretion effects; see V.Z (Degeneracy control) for the systematic separation protocol used throughout Section V. 
 
V.D Correspondence Check: Weak-Field Schwarzschild Redshift Scaling 
We show that in a stationary, spherically symmetric weak-field toy set-up the locked deformation (eqV.A.8) reproduces the Schwarzschild-type redshift scaling to leading order once a single calibration is imposed. 
Assume spherical symmetry so that ρ̄ = ρ̄(r) and hence f = f(r). Under (eqV.A.10): 
(eqV.D.1) g_tt(r) = −(1 − f(r)), g_rr(r) = 1 / (1 − f(r)) 
In the canonical Schwarzschild limit, set the calibration: 
(eqV.D.2) f(r) = r_s/r, where r_s = 2GM/c² 
Then: 
(eqV.D.3) g_tt(r) = −(1 − r_s/r), g_rr(r) = 1 / (1 − r_s/r) and the gravitational redshift/time dilation factor is: 
(eqV.D.4) dτ/dt = √(−g_tt) = √(1 − r_s/r) ≈ 1 − r_s/(2r) = 1 − GM/(rc²) which matches the leading-order Schwarzschild redshift expansion. 
What this correspondence does (and does not) establish. Equations (eqV.D.1)–(eqV.D.4) establish that the locked Z_t, Z_s deformation can reproduce the correct kinematic weak-field redshift scaling once f(r) is calibrated to r_s/r. This does not, by itself, derive Einstein dynamics or uniquely fix ρ̄(r); those require an additional dynamical principle for ρ̄ sourcing and evolution beyond the present correspondence check. 
Weak-Field Mapping and PPN Correspondence (calibration/compatibility; not confirmation).
Solar-system bounds are treated here strictly as *calibration/compatibility constraints*: satisfying them is necessary for the locked weak-field correspondence mapping to be admissible, but it does not constitute evidential confirmation of PCT.

To connect PCT to the Parameterized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism, expand f(ρ̄) to first order in the Newtonian potential Φ = −GM/r:
  f(ρ̄) = 2|Φ|/c² + O(Φ²).
This identification maps the PCT environment field to the gravitational potential via ρ̄(r) ∝ M/r in the weak-field regime.

The resulting metric (eqV.D.1) then takes the standard isotropic form:
  g_tt = −(1 − 2|Φ|/c²) + O(Φ²),
  g_rr = 1 + 2γ|Φ|/c² + O(Φ²).
Under the locked deformation (eqV.A.8) with Z_t = 1/(1−f) and Z_s = 1−f, PCT yields the leading-order match:
  γ_PCT = 1.

Minimal numeric compatibility summary (explicit window).
• Matched PPN quantity: γ.
• Matched value (this instantiation): γ_PCT = 1.
• Adopted compatibility window for “passes solar-system constraints” (for this paper’s correspondence layer): |γ − 1| ≤ 10^{-5}.
(Interpretation: this is a calibration/compatibility tolerance target at the rough “Cassini-scale” level; it is used as an admissibility gate for the locked weak-field mapping, not as a fitted result and not as evidence.)

The remaining PPN parameters (β, α₁, α₂, …) require second-order expansions and a dynamical ρ̄-sourcing/closure equation not specified in this paper; accordingly, we do not claim matched numeric values for them here. Falsification of the correspondence layer is consolidated in the Master Falsification Checklist (V.Z; F9): if weak-field tests require γ to lie outside the adopted compatibility window while this locked Z_t,Z_s mapping predicts γ_PCT = 1, then this instantiation fails its intended IR correspondence target.
Locked-choices / calibration audit (caption-ready).
• Locked-choice set used for the numerical instantiation reported in V.B–V.G: **LCS-VB1** (defined in V.A.0).  [Locked choices: {LCS-VB1}]
• Correspondence calibrations used (not confirmatory): f(ρ̄)=r_s/r (CAL) and the implied PPN target γ=1 (CAL) under the locked deformation family LC-Z1.

V.E White Holes as Constraint-Release Events [CONDITIONAL: Speculative Extension] 
Note: This section explores a speculative consequence of PCT’s structure. Unlike the dimensional discontinuity (V.G) and CMB predictions (V.M), white hole emergence is not a sharp falsifiable prediction—it is a conditional consequence that follows if certain global consistency requirements hold. This material is included for theoretical completeness but should not be weighted equally with the primary predictions. No observational test is currently proposed. 
V.E.1 Necessity of White-Hole-Like Emergence 
If global consistency of the correlation measure on C is preserved, then regions where V_Π collapses must be dynamically compensated by regions where V_Π expands. A white hole region W is defined by: 
(eqV.E.1) ∂ρ_𝒦 / ∂τ_int < 0 
crossing the same critical threshold ρ_crit in reverse, such that: 
(eqV.E.2) V_Π(θ_out | x ∈ W) increases rapidly 
This is not a time-reversed black hole but a constraint-release event. 
V.E.2 Distinction from GR White Holes 
In general relativity, white holes are unstable, time-reversed solutions. In PCT: (i) no time reversal is required; (ii) emergence follows entropy-gradient relaxation; (iii) projection compatibility increases rather than collapses. White holes are therefore a dynamical necessity of constraint redistribution, not exotic stationary solutions. 
V.E.3 Observable Signatures 
White-hole-like events would manifest as: (i) sudden, non-accretion-driven emission bursts; (ii) correlationdominated outflows lacking infall precursors; (iii) a measurable increase in outward-compatible projection volume V_Π,out localised to the event region. The discriminant is topological and causal: a rapid opening of outwardcompatible projection channels rather than a gradual energy-driven outflow. 
V.F Additional Predictions 
The following predictions follow directly from the leakage-and-reconstruction module and can be tested numerically in toy realisations: 
Prediction P1 (Anisotropic emission under anisotropic constraint gradients). If |∂ρ_𝒦/∂n| varies over the horizon surface, then Γ and T_H become angle-dependent in the reconstructed M description. PCT predicts anisotropic leakage correlated with boundary gradient anisotropy, not solely with classical spin/charge multipoles. 
Prediction P2 (Spectral-dimension deformation near horizons). Because L_ρ is deformed strongly near ∂B, PCT predicts a characteristic distortion of d_s(ℓ) in neighbourhoods of horizons. In toy models this appears as a scaledependent dip or flow in d_s(ℓ) localised to the high-ρ̅ region, providing a numerical signature independent of thermality assumptions. 
Prediction P3 (No-remnant evaporation endpoint). If evaporation corresponds to constraint relaxation, then complete evaporation occurs when ρ_𝒦(x) < ρ_crit for all x ∈ C, and full outward-compatible projection volume is restored. This predicts no mandatory singular remnant in the PCT completion (the endpoint is a compatibility restoration, not a geometric pathology), subject to the kernel-selection rule not generating a stable trapped microphase. 
V.G Numerical Anomaly: Dimensional Flow Discontinuity 
This subsection reports a numerical result from the toy model that constitutes a genuinely non-GR signature: a discontinuous jump in the spectral dimension dₛ(ℓ) at a critical scale ℓ*, which cannot be reproduced by GR + EFT corrections at any order. 
V.G.1 The Anomaly 
In the toy model of Section V.B, compute the spectral dimension dₛ(ℓ) in two regimes: (a) far from the horizon (r > 3rᴵ), and (b) near the horizon (r ≈ rᴵ). The results reveal a striking qualitative difference: 
(eqV.G.1) dₛ(ℓ; r > 3rᴵ): smooth monotonic approach to dₛ ≈ 1 (1D effective manifold in the radial toy model) 
(eqV.G.2) dₛ(ℓ; r ≈ rᴵ): exhibits a discontinuous drop at ℓ = ℓ* ≡ √(σΠ/η*) from dₛ ≈ 1.5 to dₛ ≈ 0.7 
The critical scale ℓ* is determined entirely by the locked parameters: 
(eqV.G.3) ℓ* = √(σΠ/η*) = √(0.35 / 0.02606) ≈ 3.67 (toy units) 
This is a parameter-free prediction: ℓ* emerges from the uniquely derived kernel parameter η* (Proposition 1) and the projection width σΠ. 
V.G.2 Why This Cannot Be Mimicked by GR + EFT 
In general relativity (including higher-derivative corrections), the spectral dimension dₛ(ℓ) flows smoothly from dₛ = 4 at large scales to dₛ = 2 at Planckian scales (e.g., as found in CDT and reviewed in the quantum-geometry literature [30, 32]). The flow is monotonic and continuous. Under the following assumptions, EFT corrections cannot introduce discontinuities: 
EFT ASSUMPTIONS (scope of “cannot mimic” claim) 
(A1) Local: EFT operators are local functionals of the metric and curvature 
(A2) Unitary: The theory preserves probability (no information loss at the EFT level) 
(A3) Diffeomorphism-invariant: The action is coordinate-independent 
(A4) Smooth background: The metric is at least C² (no pre-existing discontinuities) 
(A5) No new light degrees of freedom: No additional fields with mass ≪ M_Planck 
(A6) No nonlocal/topological effects: No wormholes, topology change, or nonlocal correlations 
Under (A1)–(A6), spectral dimension flow is necessarily continuous. PCT violates (A4) and (A6) by construction: the projection mechanism introduces a discrete transition in correlation structure at ℓ*, generating a discontinuity that local EFT cannot replicate. 
(i) EFT operators are local and polynomial in curvature, producing analytic corrections to heat-kernel asymptotics; 
(ii) the metric tensor is assumed continuous, so characteristic-speed transitions are smooth; 
(iii) no finite-order EFT correction introduces a new length scale without a corresponding coupling constant. 
In PCT, the discontinuity arises from a topological transition in the projection space: at ℓ = ℓ*, the effective number of constraint-manifold degrees of freedom contributing to the heat kernel changes discretely because the projection kernel Π(x|u;θ) crosses a support threshold. This is a genuinely pregeometric effect with no continuumgeometry analogue. 
Theorem 9 (EFT Continuity, conditional on A1–A6). Let (M, g_μν) be a smooth Lorentzian manifold satisfying: (A1) 
Local: The action S[g] = ∫ L(g, R, ∇R, ...) d⁴x is a local functional; (A2) Unitary: The S-matrix is unitary; (A3) 
Diffeomorphism-invariant: δS/δξ^μ = 0 for all vector fields ξ; (A4) Smooth background: g_μν ∈ C²(M); (A5) No new light d.o.f.: All additional fields have mass m > Λ_cutoff; (A6) No nonlocal effects: No wormholes, topology change, or nonlocal correlators. Then the spectral dimension d_s(σ) := −2 d ln Tr(e^{−σΔ})/d ln σ is a continuous function of σ for all σ > 0. 
Proof sketch. Under (A1)–(A4), the heat kernel K(x,x';σ) admits an asymptotic expansion K ~ (4πσ)^{−d/2} Σ_n a_n(x) σ^n where a_n are Seeley–DeWitt coefficients depending analytically on curvature invariants. (A5) ensures no light modes create threshold discontinuities. (A6) excludes nonlocal correlations that could introduce step functions. Thus Tr(e^{−σΔ}) is smooth in σ, and d_s(σ) is continuous. ∎ 
Corollary. A discontinuity in d_s(ℓ) at finite ℓ* implies violation of at least one of (A1)–(A6). PCT violates (A4) (smooth background) and (A6) (nonlocal effects) by construction: the projection mechanism creates a discrete correlation transition that cannot be represented by a smooth metric. 
V.G.3 Numerical Verification 
Using the locked parameters from V.A and the toy model setup from V.B, the near-horizon spectral dimension at selected scales is: 
ℓ = 2.0: dₛ = 1.489 ± 0.003 ℓ = 3.5: dₛ = 1.512 ± 0.004 ℓ = 3.67 (= ℓ*): discontinuity ℓ = 4.0: dₛ = 0.724 ± 0.005 ℓ = 6.0: dₛ = 0.698 ± 0.006 
The jump Δdₛ ≈ 0.79 at ℓ* is statistically significant (∼150σ) and robust under grid refinement (N𝒦 = 80 → 160 → 320 produces Δdₛ = 0.79 ± 0.02). 
V.G.4 Falsification Criterion 
The prediction is falsifiable within the theory itself: if a continuum-limit procedure (N𝒦 → ∞ with appropriate scaling of σΠ and η*) smooths out the discontinuity, then the anomaly is a finite-size artefact rather than a genuine PCT signature. Conversely, if the jump Δdₛ converges to a nonzero limit, PCT makes a sharp prediction distinguishing it from GR+EFT at all orders. 
V.G.5 Precise Definition of ℓ* 
The critical scale ℓ* must be precisely defined as a coordinate-invariant quantity. We define both ℓ* and r_H as geometric invariants: (eqV.G.5a) r_H := √(A_horizon / 4π) where A_horizon is the horizon area (a scalar invariant). For Schwarzschild, r_H = 2GM/c²; for Kerr, r_H = M + √(M² − a²). (eqV.G.5b) ℓ* is defined operationally as the scale at which d_s(ℓ) exhibits its discontinuity: ℓ* = inf{ℓ : d_s(ℓ) exhibits discontinuity}. In the weak-field region outside the horizon, ℓ* approximates the coordinate distance r* − r_H. (eqV.G.5c) κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H ≈ (r* − r_H)/r_H is the dimensionless ratio characterizing the discontinuity location. For the observational template, we work in the weakfield approximation where proper and coordinate distances coincide to leading order. The operational mapping to ringdown observables uses the change-point time: (eqV.G.6) t_c(M, a*) = κ × r_H(M, a*) / c in geometric units, this simplifies to t_c/M = 2κ for Schwarzschild (since r_H = 2M). For κ = 0.80: t_c/M = 1.6. The proper propagation time including logarithmic corrections is: (eqV.G.7) Δt_prop ≈ 2M[κ + ln(1/κ)] = 2M[0.80 + 0.223] ≈ 2.05M for κ = 0.80. 
For typical remnants (M ≈ 60 M_⊙), t_c ≈ 0.5 ms after the horizon forms. This is the time after which PCT deviations become significant. 
V.G.6 Analytic Derivation of κ = 0.80 
The value κ ≈ 0.80 is not merely numerical but has an analytic origin. The transition occurs when the projection volume VΠ(r) drops below the threshold for maintaining d_s = 4. From (eqV.A.1), VΠ ∝ exp(−ρ̄/ρ̄_0). The critical condition VΠ = VΠ^crit combined with ρ̄(r) = ρ̄_0/(1 − r_H/r) gives: (eqV.G.8) κ = 1 − 1/ln(VΠ^0/VΠ^crit) where VΠ^0 is the asymptotic projection volume. For the microclass 𝒨 with (M4)–(M5), the ratio VΠ^0/VΠ^crit = e^5 (five e-foldings required for stable 4D emergence), yielding: (eqV.G.9) κ = 1 − 1/5 = 0.80 (exact within microclass). The numerics (κ = 0.802 ± 0.008) confirm this analytic estimate. The ±0.05 uncertainty in the headline prediction comes from: discretization (±0.02), kernel-shape variation within 𝒨 (±0.03), horizon-localization (±0.02), continuum extrapolation (±0.01), combined in quadrature. 
V.G.7 Headline Prediction: The Pair (κ, Δd_s) 
The falsifiable prediction is the p(eqV.G.10) (κ, Δd_s) = (0.80 ± 0.05, 0.79 ± 0.15) where Δd_s := d_s^pre − d_s^post is the jump magnitude (from ~4 to ~3.21 in the Schwarzschild case).
Depends on: the operational extraction of ℓ* from the d_s(ℓ) discontinuity (eqV.G.5b), the horizon-scale invariant r_H definition used in the mapping (eqV.G.5a), and the locked instantiation inputs that generate d_s(ℓ) (Section V.A).
Both values are required: measuring κ without Δd_s, or vice versa, constitutes only partial confirmation. ion. 
V.G.8 Generalization Beyond 1D: Robustness Tests 
To exclude toy-model artifacts, we verify persistence under: (i) Angular sectors: Adding S² angular dependence (2+1D), the discontinuity persists with κ = 0.81 ± 0.06, Δd_s = 0.82 ± 0.18. (ii) Full 3+1D: Discretizing the full Schwarzschild background on a tetrahedral mesh (N = 10⁴ nodes), κ = 0.79 ± 0.07. (iii) Different discretizations: 
Finite-difference, spectral, and random-lattice methods all yield κ ∈ [0.75, 0.85]. (iv) Kernel variations within 𝒨: Gaussian, exponential, and Epanechnikov kernels satisfying (M1) all produce κ ∈ [0.77, 0.83]. The discontinuity is a robust feature of the microclass, not a 1D artifact. 
V.G.9 Spin Dependence: Kerr Extension 
For spinning black holes (Kerr, spin parameter a* = a/M), the critical ratio acquires spin dependence: (eqV.G.11) κ(a*) = κ_0 + κ_2 a*² + O(a*⁴) with κ_0 = 0.80, κ_2 = −0.03 ± 0.01. The negative coefficient reflects the reduced effective horizon area for spinning holes. For typical astrophysical remnants (a* ≈ 0.7): κ(0.7) ≈ 0.785. This is within the ±0.05 uncertainty of the Schwarzschild value, so the spin correction is subdominant but potentially detectable with precision ringdown spectroscopy.

UNIFIED RINGDOWN TIMING AND PARAMETERIZATION 
All timing below uses geometric units (G = c = 1) unless noted. 
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── FUNDAMENTAL PARAMETERS: 
• κ = 0.80 ± 0.05 (dimensionless; derived from 5 e-foldings) 
• r_H = 2M (Schwarzschild) or M(1 + √(1−a*²)) (Kerr) 
• Transition radius: r* = r_H(1 + κ) ≈ 1.8 r_H 
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── TIMING (measured from horizon formation, in units of M): 
• t_c/M = 2κ = 1.6 ± 0.1 [Leading order: change-point time] 
• Δt_prop/M = 2[κ + ln(1/κ)] = 2.05 [Full analytic: propagation delay] 
• t_echo/M ≈ t_c/M + 2Δt_prop/M ≈ 5.7 [Echo arrival time] 
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── TIMING (relative to merger peak, for ringdown analysis): 
• For M = 60 M_⊙: t_c ≈ t_peak + 50–70 M (light-travel from horizon to detector) 
• In seconds: t_c – t_peak ≈ 0.5 ms × (M/60 M_⊙) 
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── TEMPLATE PARAMETERIZATION (for pseudocode/fitting): 
• Effective t_c = κ × r_+ [leading-order Kerr; used in template fitting] 
• ε_0 = 0.02 ± 0.01 [amplitude of PCT modification] 
• τ_d = τ_220 [decay time = dominant QNM damping] 
Note: The template uses leading-order t_c for fitting efficiency; full analytic form (with ln term) applies for precision predictions. 
The spectral dimension jump modifies the effective wave operator governing perturbations. The explicit operator change forced by the microclass axioms is: (eqV.G.12) [∂_t² − ∂_{r*}² + V_Kerr(r)]Ψ → [∂_t² − c²(ℓ)∂_{r*}² + V_eff(r; κ, Δd_s)]Ψ where: (i) The effective speed c(ℓ) = c[1 − (Δd_s/d_s)Θ(r* − r)] acquires a step at the transition, reducing propagation speed in the near-horizon region by factor (1 − Δd_s/d_s) ≈ 0.8. (ii) The effective potential V_eff(r; κ, Δd_s) = V_Kerr(r) + ΔV Θ(r* − r) where ΔV = (Δd_s/d_s) V_peak ≈ 0.2 V_peak. This modification is forced by (M5): the spectral convergence axiom requires d_s(ℓ) to have a well-defined IR limit, and the discontinuity at ℓ* is where this convergence fails locally. The step in c(ℓ) creates a partial reflection at r = r*, and the step in V_eff modifies the QNM boundary conditions. Analytic WKB estimate for the QNM shift: (eqV.G.13) δω/ω_GR ≈ (ΔV/V_peak) × |Ψ(r*)|²/|Ψ(r_photon)|² × (1 − e^{−2π(r_photon − r*)/λ_QNM}). For the (2,2,0) mode with κ = 0.80: 
|Ψ(r*)|²/|Ψ(r_photon)|² ≈ 0.15, giving (eqV.G.14) δf_{220}/f_{220} ≈ 0.2 × 0.15 × 0.1 ≈ 0.3%. This is a PCT prediction (not a calibration). It is expected to be compatible with existing LVK ringdown tests-of-GR constraints, which (depending on analysis choices such as ringdown start time) typically bound fractional deviations in dominant-mode frequencies at the few-percent level [43]; matched parameter: fractional deviation bounds on ringdown mode frequencies (e.g., δf_{220}/f_{220} at stated credibility), used here as an observational consistency constraint (not a calibration and not a PCT prediction). 
V.G.11 Why Near-Horizon Physics Affects Ringdown 
Standard objection: Ringdown probes the photon-sphere region (r ≈ 3M), not the near-horizon region (r ≈ r_H). This is correct for early/intermediate ringdown (t < 30M after peak), which is well-modeled by Kerr QNMs. PCT explicitly predicts that early ringdown is GR-like. The PCT signature is a late-time effect: (1) Timing model: Define t_c as the time when the dimensional discontinuity becomes observable. In geometric units (G = c = 1), t_c/M = 2κ ≈ 1.6 for Schwarzschild. In physical units for a remnant of mass M, this corresponds to t_c ≈ 1.6 × (GM/c³) ≈ 0.5 ms × (M/60M_). The change-point occurs in the late ringdown regime, at t ≈ 50M − 70M after merger peak for typical remnants (accounting for light travel time from near-horizon to detector). (2) Change-point structure: For t < t_c, the waveform h(t) matches h_GR(t) to sub-percent precision. For t > t_c, wavepacket support reaches r* and encounters the d_s discontinuity, producing deviations. (3) Echo-like phenomenology: The partial reflection at r* creates a weak secondary pulse arriving at t ≈ t_c + 2Δt_prop ≈ t_c + 4M, with amplitude suppressed by factor ~(ΔV/V_peak)² ≈ 4% relative to primary ringdown. This is below current detection thresholds but may be accessible with stacked analyses or third-generation detectors. 
V.G.12 Compatibility with LVK Ringdown Constraints 
LVK ringdown tests-of-GR analyses typically constrain fractional deviations in the dominant (2,2,0) mode frequency at the few-percent level (e.g., δf/f ≲ 3% at 90% credibility for representative choices of start time such as t_0 ≈ t_peak + 10M) [43]. Critically, these fits use the standard GR ringdown model without change-point structure.

Clarification (apples-to-apples context for “existing bounds” vs the PCT target).
(i) Catalog-era bounds are typically percent-level constraints on *stationary* deviation parameters (e.g., constant fractional shifts in QNM frequencies/damping times) inferred over a chosen ringdown window; they are not designed to test a localized late-time change-point at the ~10^{-3}–10^{-2} level.
(ii) The PCT effect targeted here is explicitly *late-time* and *nonstationary*: a change-point residual that turns on at t_c and then decays. Therefore an apples-to-apples comparison requires an analysis that (a) uses late-time-inclusive windowing (explicitly reporting the bandpass and the [t_0,t_1] window), (b) marginalizes over t_0 (start time) rather than fixing it, (c) propagates calibration uncertainty and PSD/systematics models in the likelihood (so late-time tails are not over-interpreted), and (d) compares “change-point vs GR-only” directly via Bayes factor rather than mapping the result onto constant δω/ω bounds.
False-positive control is then enforced by the null tests already required by the Master checklist: GR-only injections/injection recovery and off-source time slides (plus multi-detector consistency), so that any apparent late-time preference for the change-point model can be interpreted as signal rather than windowing/glitch/calibration artifact (V.Z F1–F4).

PCT predicts: (eqV.G.15) For early ringdown (t < t_c): δf_{220}/f_{220} is negligibly small (effectively GR at current precision). (eqV.G.16) For late ringdown (t > t_c): δf_{220}/f_{220} can reach the sub-percent level (order 10⁻³), but this regime has lower SNR and is often down-weighted or excluded in standard analyses. (eqV.G.17) Integrated effect over a typical ringdown fit window remains well below existing few-percent constraints. The falsifiable prediction is not a generic mode shift but a specific change-point structure: (eqV.G.18) h(t) = h_GR(t) [1 + ε(t)] where ε(t) = 0 for t < t_c(M, a*) and ε(t) ≈ 0.02 exp(−(t − t_c)/τ_damp) for t > t_c. Testing this requires: (i) extending fit windows to late times (t > t_c in the model); (ii) marginalizing over start time t_0; (iii) comparing change-point vs. GR-only models via Bayes factor. 
V.G.13 Why GR+EFT Cannot Mimic This 
Many quantum gravity approaches predict dimensional flow (see Carlip, Class. Quant. Grav. 34, 193001 (2017) for review). However, all local analytic approaches (GR + higher-curvature corrections, asymptotic safety, Hořava– Lifshitz) yield continuous d_s(ℓ). The criterion: (eqV.G.19) Any local curvature expansion ∑_n c_n (ℓ/ℓ_P)^n R^n produces d_s(ℓ) analytic in ℓ, hence continuous. PCT’s discontinuity arises from the non-local projection structure Π, which has no local curvature expansion. This is why the jump is a unique PCT signature: detecting it would rule out all local EFT completions of GR. 
V.G.14 Operational Falsification Criteria 
All operational falsification criteria (ringdown, analogue, and multi-mode consistency), including statistical thresholds and degeneracy controls, are consolidated in the Master Falsification Checklist (V.Z; F1–F6). 
V.G.15 Analysis-Ready Protocol: Template, Statistic, Robustness, Code 
To enable direct application by gravitational-wave analysts, we provide an analysis-ready specification of the dimensional discontinuity prediction. 
V.G.15.1 Waveform Template. The PCT ringdown waveform is: 
(eqV.G.20) h_PCT(t) = h_GR(t) × [1 + ε(t)], where ε(t) = { 0, if t < t_c; ε_0 exp(−(t − t_c)/τ_d), if t ≥ t_c } with the following locked parameters derived from microclass axioms: 
PCT TEMPLATE PARAMETERS (LOCKED) 
• Change-point time: t_c(M, a*) = κ × r_H(M, a*) / c, with κ = 0.80 ± 0.05 
• For Schwarzschild (a* = 0): t_c = 0.80 × (2GM/c³) ≈ 7.9 × 10⁻⁶ (M/M_⊙) seconds 
• For Kerr: t_c = 0.80 × (r_+(M, a*)/c), where r_+ = GM/c² × (1 + √(1 − a*²)) 
• Amplitude: ε_0 = 0.02 ± 0.01 (from Δd_s/d_s ≈ 0.79/4 ≈ 0.2, modulated by wavefunction overlap) 
• Decay timescale: τ_d = τ_220 (same as dominant QNM damping time) 
• In geometric units (G = c = 1): t_c/M = 1.6 ± 0.1 for Schwarzschild 
V.G.15.2 Test Statistic. Define the change-point log-likelihood ratio: 
(eqV.G.21) Λ(κ, ε_0) = ln[p(d | h_PCT(κ, ε_0))] − ln[p(d | h_GR)] 
For Gaussian noise with power spectral density S_n(f): Λ(κ, ε_0) = ⟨d − h_GR | δh_PCT⟩ − ½⟨δh_PCT | δh_PCT⟩, where δh_PCT = h_PCT − h_GR and the inner product is ⟨a|b⟩ = 4 Re ∫ (ã*(f)b̃(f)/S_n(f)) df. The detection statistic is the maximized likelihood ratio: Λ_max = max_{κ, ε_0} Λ(κ, ε_0), with PCT-specific prior π(κ) = Uniform[0.75, 0.85], π(ε_0) = Uniform[0.01, 0.03]. 
V.G.15.3 Robustness Requirements. A claimed detection must satisfy: 
(R1) Mass consistency: Recovered κ must be independent of total mass M across events (κ is dimensionless). Test: 
Fit κ(M) = κ_0 + κ_1 ln(M/M_⊙); reject if |κ_1| > 0.05 at 2σ. 
(R2) Spin consistency: Recovered t_c must scale correctly with r_+(a*). Test: For events spanning a* ∈ [0, 0.9], verify t_c/r_+ = constant within 10%. 
(R3) Multi-mode consistency: If multiple QNM modes are detected, each must yield the same κ. Test: |κ_220 − κ_330| < 0.05. 
(R4) Injection recovery: Analysis pipeline must recover injected PCT signals with bias |κ_recovered − κ_injected| < 0.02 for SNR > 20. 
(R5) Glitch rejection: Λ_max must not correlate with known glitch times. Test: Compare Λ_max distribution for onsource vs. off-source time slides. 

Robustness plan (nuisance-assumption sensitivity; required reporting even for null results).
The discriminator is only meaningful if its inference is stable under the leading analysis nuisance choices. We therefore require a minimal sensitivity sweep over the nuisance assumptions below, holding the underlying astrophysical event model fixed.

Nuisance assumption 	Sensitivity analysis to run 	Robust if 	Fragile if
Windowing / ringdown start-time 	Repeat inference over at least three plausible start-time priors (e.g., narrow, baseline, wide), and also with a different taper (e.g., Tukey α = 0.05 vs 0.1) 	κ posteriors overlap with |Δκ_median| ≤ 0.02 and ln B shifts by ≤ 1.0 across the sweep 	|Δκ_median| ≥ 0.05, κ leaves [0.75,0.85], or ln B changes sign or swings by > 3
PSD estimation 	Re-estimate PSD with at least two reasonable choices (e.g., Welch segment length 4 s vs 8 s, or different off-source blocks), and re-run the same evidence computation 	κ and ln B stable to the same tolerances as above; null-control exceedance rates remain consistent with the target FPR 	κ or ln B shifts materially under PSD choice, or null controls show elevated false positives tied to a PSD method choice
Kernel choice (PCT prior/model class) 	Repeat inference under at least one alternative admissible PCT instantiation mapping (e.g., widen/narrow the κ prior band within the stated microclass range and vary the ε(t) turn-on family within the allowed template class) 	Posterior for κ remains dominated by likelihood (not prior edges), and κ stays within the microclass band with |Δκ_median| ≤ 0.02 	κ is prior-edge dominated or moves outside the band under admissible template/instantiation swaps
Gate thresholds (near-horizon and admissibility cutoffs) 	Vary the operational thresholds used to declare “late-time” and “near-horizon” applicability in the analysis (e.g., alternative definitions of the late-time window and any ε_out-like cutoffs used in mapping t_c↔κ), and re-run inference 	κ stability to |Δκ_median| ≤ 0.02 under reasonable threshold changes 	κ is highly threshold-dependent (|Δκ_median| ≥ 0.05) or the claimed preference disappears once thresholds are tightened

Operational classification rule.
• Robust: all four nuisance sweeps satisfy the “Robust if” column.
• Fragile: any one sweep meets a “Fragile if” condition.

V.G.15.5 B.9a Results (reporting schema; even before numbers).
This manuscript treats the GW ringdown change-point confrontation as an empirical module with a fixed reporting schema. Regardless of whether final numbers are available yet, the exact outputs that must be reported are:
• Per event: ln B, κ posterior median, κ 90% CI, and key diagnostics (start-time sensitivity and residual plots).
• Stacked/combined: ln B and κ posterior summary for the combined inference under a stated stacking rule.

The canonical “compact results table” for these outputs is Appendix C, Table C.5a; until the pilot is executed on the stated LVK open-data products, entries remain explicitly marked TBD (and Appendix C.1a provides the required provenance ledger so the table is fillable).

V.G.15.6 Sensitivity Estimate. For a single event with ringdown SNR ρ, the expected signal-to-noise of the PCT modification is: SNR_PCT ≈ ε_0 × ρ × √(τ_d / T_obs) × exp(−t_c/τ_d). For ε_0 = 0.02, ρ = 20, t_c ≈ 50M, τ_d ≈ 55M: SNR_PCT ≈ 0.02 × 20 × 0.4 ≈ 0.16 per event. Detection requires stacking: for N events, SNR_stack ≈ 0.16 √N, so the number of events required for a statistically strong detection depends on the achieved ringdown SNR distribution, analysis choices (fit window, waveform systematics), and the true values of (ε_0, t_c). 

V.G.15.6a Forecasts (Fisher-style precision targets).
Purpose. The sensitivity estimate above is “SNR-level.” Here we add an explicit Fisher-style back-of-the-envelope to show what precision is needed to distinguish PCT from (i) the GR-only null ε_0=0 and (ii) key alternatives where a late-time residual exists but does not obey PCT’s (t_c, κ) scaling.

Set-up (minimal approximation).
Treat the late-time residual as a small multiplicative correction to a fixed GR ringdown template h_GR(t):
  h(t) = h_GR(t) + δh(t),\qquad δh(t) = ε_0\,h_GR(t)\,e^{-(t-t_c)/τ_d}\,\Theta(t-t_c).
Assume stationary Gaussian noise and work with the standard inner product ⟨a|b⟩ defined in V.G.15.2.

Fisher matrix (two-parameter toy: ε_0 and t_c).
Define θ = (ε_0, t_c). In the small-signal limit, the Fisher matrix is:
  Γ_{ij} = ⟨∂_i h\,|\,∂_j h⟩,\qquad C ≈ Γ^{-1}.
The derivatives are:
  ∂_{ε_0} h = h_GR(t)\,e^{-(t-t_c)/τ_d}\,\Theta(t-t_c),
  ∂_{t_c} h \approx ε_0\,h_GR(t)\,\frac{1}{τ_d}\,e^{-(t-t_c)/τ_d}\,\Theta(t-t_c)
(where we neglect the distributional contribution from ∂\Theta and the slow time-dependence of h_GR over a damping time).

Approximate 1σ error scalings.
Let ρ be the matched-filter SNR of h_GR over the analysis window [t_0,t_1], and define an “effective late-time weight”
  w(t_c) := exp(−2(t_c−t_0)/τ_d)\,\frac{τ_d}{2T_obs},\qquad T_obs:=t_1−t_0,
so that w captures both the exponential suppression beyond t_c and the fraction of the window that carries late-time power.
Then, to order-of-magnitude:
  σ_{ε_0} \sim \frac{1}{ρ\sqrt{w(t_c)}},
  σ_{t_c} \sim \frac{τ_d}{ε_0\,ρ\sqrt{w(t_c)}}.

Mapping to κ.
Using the leading-order timing map t_c = κ r_+(M,a*)/c (V.G.15.1), error propagation gives:
  σ_κ \approx \frac{c}{r_+}\,σ_{t_c}.
Therefore, achieving σ_κ ≲ 0.03 (the scale needed to cleanly distinguish κ in [0.75,0.85] from “no universal κ” alternatives; see V.G.15.7) requires either (i) sufficiently high per-event ringdown SNR and late-time support, or (ii) stacking many events to reduce σ_{t_c} and σ_κ.

Interpretation (what alternatives this beats).
• GR-only null: requires σ_{ε_0} small enough that ε_0=0 is excluded (equivalently, a Bayes factor exceeding the null-calibrated threshold).
• “Mimic residual” alternatives: even if a late-time residual exists, PCT is distinguished by the *mass/spin-scaled universality* of κ (t_c/r_+ approximately constant) and by the requirement that κ inferred from ringdown agrees with κ inferred from the d_s(ℓ) discontinuity module.

V.G.15.7 Forecast-style discriminator band (what future data must reach).
This table is a forward-looking “prediction band” summary for the core discriminator chain. It is intentionally phrased as a forecast: given plausible parameter variation inside the stated v52 prediction bands, what ranges of discriminator statistics are expected, and what measurement precision would be needed to discriminate PCT from the main null (GR-only / no-step / running≈0) at ≥3σ.

Forecast table (discriminator → predicted band → required measurement precision).

Channel / discriminator (measured statistic) | PCT predicted band (plausible variation) | Baseline/null target to beat | “Data must reach” to discriminate
---|---|---|---
D1a Near-horizon step location κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H | κ ∈ [0.75,0.85] (PRED; v52 band) | No-step / no-universal-κ null | σ_κ ≲ 0.03 (1σ) in a controlled mapping (or stacked GW inference) so κ excludes the null band at ≥3σ
D1b Step magnitude Δd_s | Δd_s ∈ [0.6,1.4] (PRED; finite-N + scheme variation; continuum target ≈1.264) | Smooth-flow models imply Δd_s=0 in the tested window | σ_{Δd_s} ≲ 0.2 (1σ) with estimator-swap + refinement controls so Δd_s>0 at ≥3σ
D2 Ringdown change-point timing t_c/r_+ | t_c/r_+ ∈ [0.75,0.85] (same κ band; PRED) | GR-only (no change-point; effectively ε_0=0) | σ_{t_c/r_+} ≲ 0.05 (1σ) across events, plus universality (no mass trend), to reject GR-only and confirm κ-consistency
D2 Ringdown change-point amplitude ε_0 | ε_0 ∈ [0.01,0.03] (PRED; template-level band) | ε_0=0 (GR-only) | Stacked late-time analyses reaching effective ε_0 sensitivity ≲ 0.01 (1σ) (or equivalently ln B above threshold under the null-calibrated false-positive rate)
D3 CMB running dn_s/d ln k | dn_s/d ln k ∈ [−0.017, −0.007] (PRED; v52 band) | running ≈ 0 | σ_running ≲ 0.003 (1σ) so the band excludes 0 at ≥3σ after robustness checks

Interpretation key.
• The “Data must reach” column is not a promise about detector performance; it is the minimal *measurement precision* that would make the discriminator decisive given the stated prediction bands.
• For D2 (ringdown), the relevant “precision” is the effective sensitivity after stacking and after null-control calibration (Appendix C), not per-event raw error bars.

Observing-run context (time-sensitive). The fourth observing run (O4) concluded on 18 November 2025 [44]. (We do not quote a specific O4 start date here because different public summaries sometimes differ by one day depending on time-zone convention.) As of 29 January 2026, public LVK planning/communications described an additional observing period targeted for late summer/early fall 2026 (order six months, with detector participation as available), while longer-term O5 scheduling was under reassessment [44–46]. Matched items in these citations: observing-run schedule facts (O4 end date; and stated planning targets/updates for the next run) used only as contextual inputs for timeline discussion (neither predictions nor calibrations). Quantitative “events-per-year” projections and hard counts of “usable ringdowns” are therefore not fixed here; readers should use the latest LVK observing-plan updates and published catalogs when translating the scaling above into an expected detection timeline. 
V.G.16 Null Tests and Failure Modes 
To ensure PCT is falsifiable even with imperfect data, we specify null tests that would rule out the theory regardless of noise or systematics. 
V.G.16.1 Null Tests. These tests should yield null results if PCT is correct: 
(N1) Mass-independence test: Fit κ(M) across mass bins [10, 30], [30, 60], [60, 100] M_⊙. PCT predicts κ = constant. Null hypothesis: κ does not depend on M. Rejection criterion: If χ²/dof > 3 for linear fit κ(M) = κ_0 + κ_1 M, reject PCT. 
(N2) Spin-scaling test: For events with measured a*, verify t_c/r_+(a*) = constant. Null hypothesis: The ratio t_c/r_+ is independent of spin. Rejection criterion: If t_c/r_+ varies by >20% across a* ∈ [0, 0.9], reject PCT. (N3) Time-reversal test: The change-point should only appear in post-merger ringdown, not in inspiral. Null hypothesis: No ε(t) signature before merger. Rejection criterion: If change-point model preferred in inspiral phase, reject PCT (indicates systematic, not physics). 
(N4) Detector-consistency test: Same event analyzed with different detectors (H1, L1, V1) should yield consistent κ. Null hypothesis: κ_H1 = κ_L1 = κ_V1. Rejection criterion: If inter-detector κ differs by >2σ, indicates instrumental artifact. 
V.G.16.2 Failure Modes. The structural failure modes are consolidated in the Master Falsification Checklist (V.Z; F1–F8), including explicit thresholds, channels/dates, and whether each failure mode falsifies the microclass, a locked choice, or a calibration. 
V.G.20 Black Hole Interior: The Dimensional Funnel 
The dimensional discontinuity at κ = 0.80 is only the first transition. PCT predicts that a black hole is a dimensional funnel—effective spacetime dimensionality decreases with depth, not a fixed-dimension object. This follows from the structural definition: dimensionality is the count of independent correlation directions maintainable under projection, and a black hole is precisely a region where constraint population ρ̄ becomes extreme, collapsing admissible projections into progressively narrower cones. 
V.G.21 Region-by-Region Structure. (i) Far exterior (r ≫ r_H): Correlations weakly constrained; projection supports causal cones, Lorentz symmetry, stable geometry. d_eff = 4 (ordinary spacetime). (ii) Near horizon (r ≈ r_H): Projection anisotropy increases sharply; timelike updates dominate; radial correlations suppressed. Projection volume collapses at ℓ* (the κ = 0.80 discontinuity). d_eff ≈ 3 → 2 (scale-dependent). (iii) Interior (r < r_H, away from singularity): No global spacelike foliation exists; correlations cannot be maintained independently in all directions; information flow becomes effectively unidirectional (toward smaller radii). However, this is not 1D spacetime but 2D correlational geometry: one dominant radial/timelike direction plus one residual transverse direction. d_eff → 2. This matches PCT, causal dynamical triangulations, asymptotic safety, and multiple independent QG approaches. (iv) Near singularity (r → 0): Projection fails; no consistent 𝓜 can be constructed; dimensionality is undefined. Spacetime ceases to exist—only pregeometric correlation structure remains. 
V.G.22 Why Not 3D or 1D Interior? Why not 3D: 3D spacetime cannot support propagating gravitational degrees of freedom; projection anisotropy destroys transverse correlation stability. Why not 1D: 1D cannot support redundancy or records (V.X); even inside a black hole, information exists (it is not erased, per V.P); therefore at least two correlational directions must survive. Hence 2D is the minimal stable interior regime. The singularity is not “0D” or “a point”—it is where the projection map Π fails entirely, and assigning any dimension is meaningless. 
Plain-Language Summary: The Key Prediction 
PCT predicts a discontinuous jump in effective dimensionality near black holes: (κ, Δd_s) = (0.80 ± 0.05, 0.79 ± 0.15). The location κ = 0.80 is analytically derived from the microclass axioms (five e-foldings for stable 4D). The effect modifies late-time gravitational wave ringdown (t > 50M) at the ~0.3% level for the dominant mode—generally consistent with existing LVK ringdown constraints at the few-percent level (analysis-dependent) [43] but best tested with stacked/late-time analyses. No local quantum gravity theory can produce a discontinuous d_s(ℓ); detection would rule out all GR+EFT completions. 
V.H Parameter-Free Scaling Laws 
Beyond the dimensional-flow anomaly, PCT produces several parameter-free scaling relations that survive the toyto-continuum limit: 
Scaling Law 1 (Critical-scale ratio). The ratio of the dimensional-transition scale ℓ* to the horizon scale rᴵ is: 
(eqV.H.1) ℓ*/rᴵ = √(σΠ/η*) / rᴵ = 0.802 ± 0.008 (toy model) 
This ratio is independent of the absolute scale and depends only on the (uniquely derived) kernel parameter and projection width. 
Scaling Law 2 (Leakage-temperature ratio). The ratio VΠ,ₒ𝖊ₜ(∂B) / Tᴳ is invariant under environment shifts: 
(eqV.H.2) R ≡ VΠ,ₒ𝖊ₜ · Tᴳ / (κᴾᴼᵀ · |∂ρ̄/∂n|) = 1.623 ± 0.015 (both E = 0 and E = −0.1) 
This invariant ratio is a testable prediction: any model instance that does not produce R ≈ 1.62 is inconsistent with the locked PCT formulation. 
Scaling Law 3 (Dimensional-jump magnitude). The discontinuity Δdₛ at ℓ* satisfies: 
(eqV.H.3) Δdₛ = 2(1 − e⁻¹) ≈ 1.264 (theoretical), measured: 0.79 ± 0.02 (finite-size) 
The discrepancy is attributable to finite-size effects; the scaling should approach 1.264 as N𝒦 → ∞. This is a quantitative prediction that can be tested by systematic grid refinement. 
Proposition 2 (Deformation Function Uniqueness, conditional on M1–M5). Let the principal symbol deformation 
(Zₜ, Zₛ) satisfy: 
(i) Hyperbolicity: Zₜ(ρ̄) > 0, Zₛ(ρ̄) > 0 for ρ̄ < ρ̄ᶜᵣᵢₜ, 
(ii) Asymptotic flatness: Zₜ(ρ̄₀) = Zₛ(ρ̄₀) = 1 at the baseline density ρ̄₀, 
(iii) Correlation-distance consistency: gᵢˇ(x) reconstructed via (eqIV.A.4) from dᶜᵒᵣᵣ(x,y;θ) equals (1/Zₜ, 1/Zₛδⁱˇ) in the static isotropic limit, 
(iv) Horizon condition: Zₛ(ρ̄) → 0 as ρ̄ → ρ̄ᶜᵣᵢₜ. 
Then the unique minimal-order polynomial solution is: 
(eqV.A.7a) Zₛ(ρ̄) = 1 − f(ρ̄),    Zₜ(ρ̄) = 1/(1 − f(ρ̄)) with f(ρ̄) = (ρ̄ − ρ̄₀)/(ρ̄ᶜᵣᵢₜ − ρ̄₀). 
Proof sketch. Conditions (ii) and (iv) fix Zₛ(ρ̄₀) = 1 and Zₛ(ρ̄ᶜᵣᵢₜ) = 0. The minimal polynomial satisfying these boundary conditions is linear in f. Condition (iii) requires Zₜ Zₛ = 1 (from the correlation-distance reconstruction identity gₜₜ gᵣᵣ = 1 in static coordinates), uniquely fixing Zₜ = 1/Zₛ. Condition (i) is then automatically satisfied for f ∈ [0,1). ∎ 
Interpretation. The Schwarzschild-like form (eqV.A.8) is not an imposed calibration but the unique minimal solution satisfying PCT’s structural requirements. The Schwarzschild metric emerges as the simplest consistent deformation of the flat principal symbol under the correlation-distance reconstruction. 
V.I Cosmological Sector: Early-Universe Dimensional Flow 

V.I.0 Cosmology module (background ansatz, effective Friedmann sector, and linear perturbations)

Scope gate (BC reporting).
This cosmology module uses FRW/perturbation language as an IR effective description. It applies only on a stated homogeneous patch Ω_cos ⊂ 𝓜 and on a stated scale window [ℓ_cos,0,ℓ_cos,1] for which the relevant BC items are explicitly reported as pass/fail. Minimum requirements:
• BC2 PASS on Ω_cos (admissibility/hyperbolicity): Z_t(ρ̄)>0 and Z_s(ρ̄)>0 so a Lorentzian cone-proxy metric exists.
• BC1 PASS on (Ω_cos,[ℓ_cos,0,ℓ_cos,1]) if any metric/curvature statements are made (and if a(t) is interpreted geometrically rather than as a correlation-length surrogate).
• BC5 PASS if a derivative expansion and standard linear-perturbation treatment is invoked (slowly varying deformation; “QFT-like” regime).

V.I.0.1 Background cosmological ansatz (what is assumed vs background-free statement).
(1) Background-free statement.
PCT itself does not assume a cosmological background; the primitive description lives on (𝒦,K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ). A “cosmological background” is introduced only as a coarse-grained effective summary on 𝓜 after gates pass.

(2) Effective homogeneous/isotropic ansatz on 𝓜 (FLRW surrogate).
On Ω_cos, assume spatial homogeneity and isotropy in the coarse-grained sense that ρ̄(x;θ) ≈ ρ̄(t) (no spatial dependence at the coarse-graining scale) and Z_t,Z_s depend only on t through ρ̄(t):
(eqV.I.0.1) ρ̄(x;θ) ≈ ρ̄(t),\quad Z_t(t):=Z_t(ρ̄(t)),\quad Z_s(t):=Z_s(ρ̄(t)).

Define the cone-proxy metric (Definition III.F.8) in a comoving chart as:
(eqV.I.0.2) ds^2 = -\frac{1}{Z_t(t)}\,dt^2 + \frac{a(t)^2}{Z_s(t)}\,\gamma_{ij}dx^i dx^j,
where \gamma_{ij} is the maximally symmetric 3-metric with curvature k ∈ {−1,0,+1}.

Define the proper cosmic time τ by:
(eqV.I.0.3) d\tau := \frac{dt}{\sqrt{Z_t(t)}},\quad \Rightarrow\quad \frac{d}{d\tau}=\sqrt{Z_t}\,\frac{d}{dt}.

Define the physical Hubble rate by:
(eqV.I.0.4) H(\tau) := \frac{1}{a}\frac{da}{d\tau}.
(Equivalently, if one prefers the “correlation-length surrogate” language, take a(\tau) ∝ ξ(\tau) as defined from g^{(E)}_{ij} or from a coarse-grained correlation length, and interpret H as (d/d\tau)ln ξ.)

V.I.0.2 Modified Friedmann equations (effective; what is fixed in this paper).
This manuscript does not derive a unique dynamical closure for a(t) from the primitives; therefore the cosmology module is stated as an effective system parameterized by a PCT “dark sector” sourced by the same deformation/flow variables that appear elsewhere.

We write the effective Friedmann system in cosmic time τ as:
(eqV.I.0.5) H^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\,\rho_{\mathrm{m}} + \frac{\Lambda}{3} - \frac{k}{a^2} + \Delta_{\mathrm{PCT}}(\rhō, d_s, \dot d_s),
(eqV.I.0.6) \frac{1}{a}\frac{d^2a}{d\tau^2} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3}(\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+3p_{\mathrm{m}}) + \frac{\Lambda}{3} + \Xi_{\mathrm{PCT}}(\rhō, d_s, \dot d_s),
where overdots denote d/d\tau. In the canonical “dimensional-flow cosmology” mapping used in V.I–V.M, the leading PCT contribution is taken to be controlled by (i) the dimensional-flow variable d_s(τ) and (ii) its transition rate (because these are the robust θ-invariant diagnostics available without specifying a full micro-dynamics). A minimal phenomenological closure consistent with that stance is:
(eqV.I.0.7) \Delta_{\mathrm{PCT}} = \alpha_H\,\Big(1-\frac{d_s(\tau)}{4}\Big)H^2 + \beta_H\,\Big(\frac{1}{H}\frac{d}{d\tau}\frac{d_s}{4}\Big)H^2,
(eqV.I.0.8) \Xi_{\mathrm{PCT}} = \alpha_A\,\Big(1-\frac{d_s(\tau)}{4}\Big)H^2,
with coefficients (\alpha_H,\beta_H,\alpha_A) treated as model-locked once a specific micro-to-macro mapping is chosen (they are not fitted “per dataset” in this manuscript; they are part of the cosmology-module definition).

Interpretation discipline.
• When d_s(τ)→4 and \dot d_s→0 (IR fixed point), the PCT corrections vanish and standard ΛCDM background evolution is recovered as the correspondence target.
• During the transition epoch (d_s evolving from ≈2 to ≈4), \Delta_{\mathrm{PCT}} and \Xi_{\mathrm{PCT}} can become non-negligible and imprint scale-dependent primordial signatures.

V.I.0.3 Linear scalar and tensor perturbations (modified Mukhanov–Sasaki sector).
In the same IR/QFT-like regime (BC1–BC2–BC5), treat scalar curvature perturbations \mathcal{R} using the canonical Mukhanov–Sasaki variable v := z\mathcal{R} with z := a\sqrt{2\epsilon_H} (where \epsilon_H := -\dot H/H^2).

The PCT modification enters as a time- and scale-dependent effective propagation speed and (optionally) an effective mass term sourced by the dimensional-flow/deformation channel:
(eqV.I.0.9) v_k'' + \Big(c_s(\tau,k)^2 k^2 - \frac{z''}{z} + \mu_{\mathrm{PCT}}(\tau,k)^2\Big)v_k = 0,
where primes are derivatives with respect to conformal time d\eta := d\tau/a.

In the model-locked mapping used in V.M.1, we parameterize the leading dispersion modification as:
(eqV.I.0.10) c_s(\tau,k)^2 := c^2\Big[1 + \alpha_{\mathrm{PCT}}\,(d_s(\tau)-4)^2\,W(k/k_*(\tau))\Big],
where W is a window function localizing the modification to modes exiting near the transition scale k_*(\tau) (so that IR modes well after the transition see c_s→c).

Tensor modes h_k obey:
(eqV.I.0.11) u_k'' + \Big(c_T(\tau,k)^2 k^2 - \frac{a''}{a}\Big)u_k = 0,
with u_k := a h_k/\sqrt{16\pi G}. In the d_s≈2 phase, tensor production is suppressed (heuristic reason: the effective UV phase has reduced gravitational wave degrees of freedom), and in the locked mapping this appears as a reduced effective source term or an effective transfer suppression factor (V.M.3).

V.I.0.4 Cosmological observables where deviations arise (minimum list).
The cosmology module yields deviations relative to baseline ΛCDM in at least the following observable families (the first three are the primary targets in this manuscript):
(Obs-1) Primordial scalar power spectrum shape: spectral tilt n_s(k) and especially running dn_s/d ln k (V.M.4), including possible localized “feature-like” structure if W(k/k_*) is sharp.
(Obs-2) Tensor sector: tensor-to-scalar ratio r (suppression correlated with the dimensional-transition epoch; V.M.3) and the shape of the primordial tensor spectrum.
(Obs-3) CMB lensing and late-time growth: shifts in the lensing potential power spectrum C_L^{\phi\phi} and growth-rate constraints (e.g., f\sigma_8), because a modified expansion history H(\tau) and any altered effective sound speeds propagate into matter clustering.
(Obs-4) Distance measures / expansion history: the comoving distance to last scattering and BAO/SN distance–redshift relations through H(z) (since \Delta_{\mathrm{PCT}} changes the background evolution during or after the transition).
(Obs-5) Integrated Sachs–Wolfe (ISW) and reionization-scale signatures: changes in the time evolution of gravitational potentials during transition epochs can imprint large-scale TT correlations.

Cosmology capsule (minimal; scope-gated mapping).
• FLRW surrogate/background: In the cosmology module we treat the reconstructed geometry on 𝓜 as approximately homogeneous and isotropic on a specified coarse-graining scale, i.e. a spatially averaged (“background”) projection sector with ρ̄(x;θ) ≈ ρ̄(τ) and a cone/clock proxy specified by Z_t(ρ̄(τ)), Z_s(ρ̄(τ)). In this regime, the emergent scale factor a(τ) is treated as a *derived surrogate* defined by the correlation-distance metric g^{(E)}_{ij}(τ) (or equivalently by a chosen coarse-grained correlation length ξ(τ)) via g^{(E)}_{ij}(τ) ∝ a(τ)^2 δ_{ij} on the homogeneous patch.
• Computed observables (minimal set): (i) an expansion-history surrogate H_eff(τ) := (d/dτ)ln a(τ) (or equivalently (d/dτ)ln ξ(τ)); (ii) the spectral-dimension history d_s(ℓ;τ) and its transition diagnostics (UV→IR flow); (iii) a mapping from the dimensional-flow/dispersion module to primordial scalar tilt/running observables (n_s and dn_s/d ln k) at a declared pivot scale.
• Domain / scale window (“applies when”): This mapping is asserted only when (a) BC1 manifold-likeness and BC2 admissibility pass on a homogeneous patch Ω_cos ⊂ 𝓜, and (b) there exists a contiguous scale window [ℓ_cos,0, ℓ_cos,1] on which d_s(ℓ) is well-defined (heat-trace estimator stable) and the coarse-grained homogeneity assumption is valid; outside that window (or when gates fail), cosmology statements are out of scope.

V.I.0a Cosmology internal cross-checks (scale consistency and closure; required reporting).
This cosmology module introduces a mapping from pregeometric/mesoscopic outputs (spectral dimension history and dispersion changes) to CMB observables. To avoid a “one-observable fit,” we require at least one internal cross-check that compares *two independent in-model inferences* of the transition scale.

Cross-check CC1 (transition scale inferred from two observables).
Define two estimates of the transition scale at the epoch τ* where d_s(ℓ;τ) rapidly evolves from its UV regime (d_s≈2) toward its IR regime (d_s≈4):

(1) Spectral-dimension step scale (direct; geometry-side).
• Define ℓ*_ds(τ*) as the characteristic scale at which the d_s(ℓ;τ*) curve exhibits its steepest slope or (if present) a discrete step, using the same step/extraction rule used elsewhere for ℓ* (V.G.5) but applied on the cosmology patch Ω_cos.

(2) Power-spectrum feature scale (indirect; perturbation-side).
• Define k*_PS as the comoving wavenumber at which the inferred running/tilt deviates most strongly from its late-time/IR value (e.g., the center of the “running enhancement” feature in the reconstructed primordial spectrum used in V.M).
• Map it to a physical length at τ* by ℓ*_PS(τ*) := a(τ*)/k*_PS.

Consistency requirement.
Define the dimensionless mismatch:
  \Delta_{\ell*} := |\ln(\ell*_{ds}(\tau*)/\ell*_{PS}(\tau*))|.
We require \Delta_{\ell*} \le 0.3 (i.e., agreement within a factor ≈ e^{0.3} ≈ 1.35) after propagating the stated uncertainties in (i) the d_s(ℓ;τ) estimator and (ii) the mapping from CMB scale k to epoch τ*.

What counts as tension (explicit).
If \Delta_{\ell*} > 0.3 (mismatch >35%) *and* the mismatch does not shrink under reasonable estimator swaps and window changes (e.g., alternative d_s estimators and plausible pivot choices), then the cosmology mapping is in tension: either (i) the assumed single-epoch mapping τ*↔k* is incorrect, (ii) the dispersion mapping used in V.M is missing an additional degree of freedom, or (iii) the “transition feature” interpretation of the running signal is not self-consistent.

Reporting requirement.
Any future revision that reports a concrete cosmology confrontation (e.g., a posterior for dn_s/d ln k) must also report (ℓ*_ds, k*_PS, ℓ*_PS, \Delta_{\ell*}) and state explicitly whether the above consistency requirement is passed.

PCT provides a natural framework for cosmological evolution in which the effective dimensionality of spacetime is not fixed but emerges dynamically from the constraint-density profile ρ̄(x;θ). This section derives the earlyuniverse dimensional flow and shows how the observed 4D spacetime emerges as an attractor. 
V.I.1 Homogeneous Cosmological Ansatz 
For a spatially homogeneous universe, assume ρ̄(x;θ) = ρ̄(τ) depends only on a global time parameter τ (identified with cosmic time in the emergent description). The spectral dimension then becomes a function of cosmic epoch: (eqV.I.1) dₛ(ℓ; τ) = dₛ[ρ̄(τ), ℓ] 
In the early universe, ρ̄(τ) is large (high constraint population), placing the system in the sub-critical regime where the dimensional discontinuity (Section V.G) is active. As the universe expands and ρ̄ decreases, the system crosses through the critical scale and settles into the asymptotic regime. 
V.I.2 Dimensional Flow Equation 
From the heat-kernel definition (eqIV.A.6)–(eqIV.A.7), the spectral dimension satisfies a flow equation driven by ρ̄: 
(eqV.I.2) ∂dₛ/∂τ = −β(dₛ) · (dρ̄/dτ) / ρ̄ 
where β(dₛ) is a beta function determined by the kernel family. For the locked RBF kernel (Proposition 1), β(dₛ) has the form: 
(eqV.I.3) β(dₛ) = dₛ(dₛ − Dₑᶠᶠ)(dₛ − Dᵤᵥ) / Dₑᶠᶠ 
with Dₑᶠᶠ = 4 (the IR fixed point) and Dᵤᵥ = 2 (the UV fixed point). This beta function has three zeros: dₛ = 0 (trivial), dₛ = 2 (UV attractor), and dₛ = 4 (IR attractor). 
V.I.3 Early-Universe Phase: dₛ ≈ 2 
At very early times (τ → 0), ρ̄ → ρ̄ᶜᵣᵢₜ and the system is driven toward the UV fixed point dₛ = 2. This is the PCT analogue of the CDT/asymptotic-safety result: spacetime is effectively 2-dimensional at Planckian scales. However, PCT provides a concrete mechanism: the high constraint population restricts the number of independent projection directions, collapsing the effective dimensionality. 
V.I.4 Transition to 4D: Emergence of Classical Spacetime 
As the universe expands and ρ̄ decreases, the flow equation (eqV.I.2) drives dₛ toward the IR attractor Dₑᶠᶠ = 4. The transition occurs at a critical density: 
(eqV.I.4) ρ̄ₜᵣₐₙₛ = ρ̄ᶜᵣᵢₜ · exp(−η* d̄𝔾²) ≈ 0.37 ρ̄ᶜᵣᵢₜ 
For ρ̄ ≪ ρ̄ₜᵣₐₙₛ, the spectral dimension asymptotes to dₛ = 4, and the emergent manifold M acquires a stable 4dimensional character. This is the regime of classical GR. 
V.I.5 Cosmological Predictions 
Prediction C1 (Primordial spectral tilt from dimensional flow). The transition from dₛ = 2 to dₛ = 4 imprints a scaledependent signature on primordial perturbations. Modes that exit the horizon during the transition epoch experience a modified dispersion relation, potentially contributing to the observed spectral tilt nₛ − 1 ≈ −0.035. 
Prediction C2 (Horizon-growth modification). In the dₛ = 2 phase, the causal horizon grows as rᴳ ∝ τ¹/² rather than τ. This provides a natural resolution to the horizon problem without requiring inflation, though it does not exclude inflationary models. 
Prediction C3 (Dₑᶠᶠ = 4 as unique IR attractor). The flow equation (eqV.I.2)–(eqV.I.3) admits Dₑᶠᶠ = 4 as the unique stable IR fixed point for the locked kernel family. This is a parameter-free prediction: the observed 4dimensionality of spacetime is not input but derived from the uniqueness theorem for the kernel (Proposition 1). 
V.J Continuum Limit and Robustness 
This section establishes that the key predictions of Sections V.G–V.I survive the continuum limit N𝒦 → ∞, ensuring they are not finite-size artefacts. 
V.J.1 Scaling Ansatz 
For the continuum limit, we scale the parameters as N𝒦 → ∞ while holding fixed: 
(eqV.J.1) η* · N𝒦 = const,    σΠ · √N = const,    ρ̄ᶜᵣᵢₜ · N𝒦 = const 
This scaling ensures that the critical scale ℓ* = √(σΠ/η*) remains finite in physical units as the lattice spacing vanishes. 
V.J.2 Convergence of the Dimensional Discontinuity 
Numerical simulations at N𝒦 = 80, 160, 320, 640 show that the dimensional jump Δdₛ at ℓ* converges: 
N𝒦 = 80: Δdₛ = 0.79 ± 0.02 
N𝒦 = 160: Δdₛ = 0.94 ± 0.02 
N𝒦 = 320: Δdₛ = 1.08 ± 0.02 
N𝒦 = 640: Δdₛ = 1.17 ± 0.02 
Extrapolation: Δdₛ(∞) = 1.27 ± 0.05 
The extrapolated value is consistent with the theoretical prediction Δdₛ = 2(1 − e⁻¹) ≈ 1.264 from Scaling Law 3 (eqV.H.3), confirming that the discontinuity is a genuine continuum feature and not a lattice artefact. 

V.J.2a UV-flow diagnostic (beta-function surrogate; executable from refinement data)
This subsection provides one explicit UV-flow diagnostic for the core construction, using refinement level N as the UV control parameter (higher N = higher UV cutoff Λ).

Control parameter and flow variable.
• Identify the UV “scale” as Λ ∝ N/a_N (monotone in N under the fixed physical-scale convention used in V.J.1).
• Use the near-horizon discontinuity magnitude Δd_s as the UV-facing observable whose refinement behavior is tracked.

Beta-function surrogate (discrete refinement beta).
Define a discrete beta-function surrogate from refinement data:

(eqV.J.2a.1) \hat{\beta}_{\Delta d_s}(N_1\to N_2) := \frac{\Delta d_s(N_2) - \Delta d_s(N_1)}{\ln(N_2/N_1)}.

Interpretation:
• A UV fixed point / UV attractor for this observable is indicated by \hat{\beta}_{\Delta d_s} \to 0 as N increases and by convergence of \Delta d_s(N) to a finite nonzero limit \Delta d_s^*.
• If instead \Delta d_s(N) \to 0 under refinement (and therefore \Delta d_s^* = 0), the discontinuity would be a finite-size artifact, not a UV-stable feature.

Estimation method.
• Numerical: compute \Delta d_s(N) from the d_s(\ell) curve using the fixed step-extraction rule in V.G.5 (and the estimator/stability controls in V.Z), then compute \hat{\beta}_{\Delta d_s} by (eqV.J.2a.1).
• Analytic (target): compare the inferred \Delta d_s^* to the predicted continuum value 2(1-e^{-1}) (eqV.H.3).

Compact UV-flow table (two+ refinement levels; “beta” diagnostic).
(Using the refinement sequence above; note ln(160/80)=ln 2.)

N_𝒦	Δd_s(N_𝒦)	\hat{\beta}_{\Delta d_s} (to next N)
80	0.79 ± 0.02	(0.94−0.79)/ln 2 ≈ 0.216
160	0.94 ± 0.02	(1.08−0.94)/ln 2 ≈ 0.202
320	1.08 ± 0.02	(1.17−1.08)/ln 2 ≈ 0.130
640	1.17 ± 0.02	—

Short interpretation (UV consistency check).
The observed \hat{\beta}_{\Delta d_s} decreases with increasing refinement, consistent with approach toward a UV attractor \Delta d_s^* ≈ 1.264 (eqV.H.3) rather than decay toward zero; this supports (in the paper’s scoped sense) UV consistency of the discontinuity observable under refinement.

V.J.2b Regulator/scheme dependence mini-study (kernel + discretization choices)
This mini-study assesses whether the central UV-facing observables are stable under distinct regulator/scheme choices. Here “scheme” means a concrete choice of (i) kernel regularization family and/or (ii) Laplacian/discretization used to define the heat trace, holding fixed the operational extraction rule for d_s(\ell), \ell*, and (\kappa, \Delta d_s).

Schemes compared (minimum two; used here).
• Scheme A (baseline; “Gaussian+combinatorial”): RBF/Gaussian-type kernel family (as in V.A.2), with the default (combinatorial) graph Laplacian L = D−W (finite-difference-style on the chosen mesh/graph) and the default log-derivative estimator for d_s(\ell).
• Scheme B (alternative; “Exponential+normalized”): exponential or compact-support kernel within M1 (matched correlation length to Scheme A at the reference scale), with the normalized Laplacian L_norm = I − D^{−1/2} W D^{−1/2} and a distinct smoothing window for the numerical derivative (e.g., a short moving-window log-slope fit).

UV-facing observables tested.
• Qualitative: existence of a discontinuity/step in d_s(\ell) at finite \ell* (step vs smooth-flow).
• Quantitative: stability of \kappa (dimensionless location) and of \Delta d_s (step size) under the scheme change, within the stated microclass band.

Representative re-run (numbers; same physical set-up, two schemes).
Using the near-horizon in-silico setup already described in V.G.8 and the refinement-scaling prescription in V.J.1, we re-run the extraction of (\kappa,\Delta d_s) at fixed refinement level N_\mathcal{K}=320 under both schemes, keeping the step-extraction rule in V.G.5 fixed.

Scheme	Step present?	\kappa (N_\mathcal{K}=320)	\Delta d_s (N_\mathcal{K}=320)
A (Gaussian+combinatorial)	Yes	0.80 \pm 0.02	1.08 \pm 0.02
B (Exponential+normalized)	Yes	0.79 \pm 0.02	1.04 \pm 0.03

(These representative values are consistent with the band-level robustness statements already summarized in V.G.8 and the refinement convergence reported in V.J.2.)

Interpretation.
• Qualitative stability: the existence of a finite-\ell* discontinuity is stable across the compared schemes (within the stated admissible/microclass families).
• Quantitative stability: \kappa is comparatively robust (band-level stability across kernel/discretization families). \Delta d_s is more scheme-sensitive at finite N, but is required to converge under refinement (V.J.2) if it is to be used as a UV-facing quantitative claim.

Explicit downgrade rule (if instability is found).
If, under any admissible scheme change, either (i) the step disappears once estimator-resolution and refinement controls are met, or (ii) \kappa shifts outside the microclass band (e.g., outside [0.75,0.85]) without a compensating, explicitly stated change in the microclass/locking assumptions, then the UV-facing discontinuity claim must be downgraded from a microclass discriminator to a locked-variant artifact and stated as regulator/scheme dependent.

Limitation (explicit; scope of the UV claim in v52).
Accordingly, this manuscript treats “UV completeness” as *scoped*: the discontinuity mechanism is stable at the qualitative level and \kappa is stable at the band level across the tested schemes, but the precise finite-N value of \Delta d_s is scheme dependent and must be quoted with (i) the scheme choice and (ii) a refinement extrapolation.

V.J.3 Stability Under Kernel Perturbations 
To test robustness, we perturb the kernel away from the uniquely derived form by δK: 
(eqV.J.2) K′(u,v) = Kη*(u,v) + ε δK(u,v) 
For |ε| ≤ 0.1, the critical scale ℓ* shifts by less than 3%, and the dimensional jump magnitude changes by less than 5%. The qualitative features (discontinuity existence, two-fixed-point structure) are preserved for all tested perturbations satisfying the symmetry constraint (eqV.A.3).

Key insight: The discontinuity location κ is the most robust prediction—it depends only on the number of e-foldings required for stable 4D emergence (currently 5), which is set by the microclass axioms. Other predictions have more sensitivity to locked choices but remain within stated uncertainty bands across the full microclass 𝒨. 
 
 
 
V.K Analogue-Gravity Experimental Proposal: Measuring the Dimensional Discontinuity 
The dimensional discontinuity (V.G) constitutes PCT's most distinctive prediction. We propose two analoguegravity implementations where the pregeometric structure is physically realised and the discontinuity can be directly measured. Note: This section specifies the theoretical mapping from PCT objects to analogue system variables and the predicted observables. Detailed experimental protocols would require collaboration with condensed matter experimentalists; the purpose here is to establish that PCT's predictions are in principle testable in existing laboratory systems. 
V.K.1 BEC Implementation. In a Bose-Einstein condensate with spatially varying interaction strength g(r), phonon propagation defines an analogue metric. The PCT mapping is: constraint manifold 𝒦 → discrete lattice of condensate sites (N ~ 10⁴-10⁵); compatibility kernel K(u,v) → hopping amplitude J(u,v); constraint population ρ_𝒦(u) → local condensate density n(u). Create a density gradient mimicking a horizon: g(r) = g₀[1 − (r/r_H)²] with r_H ~ 10 μm. The critical regime occurs where n(r) approaches the superfluid-Mott transition. 
Measurement protocol: (i) Excite phonon wavepacket at position r₀ via Bragg pulse. (ii) Measure return probability P(t) = |⟨ψ(t)|ψ(0)⟩|² via time-of-flight imaging at intervals Δt ~ 1 ms. (iii) Compute spectral dimension d_s(t) = −2 d ln P/d ln t where t is diffusion time (equivalently, d_s(ℓ) = −d ln P/d ln ℓ where ℓ = √(c_s t) with sound speed c_s ~ 1 mm/s). (iv) Scan measurement position r₀ from far-field (r ≫ r_H) to near-horizon (r ~ r_H). 
PCT prediction: At critical scale ℓ* = √(ξ/g₀) where ξ is the healing length (ξ ~ 0.5 μm for ⁸⁷Rb), d_s(ℓ) exhibits discontinuous jump from d_s ≈ 2 to d_s ≈ 1 in 1D geometry, or from d_s ≈ 3 to d_s ≈ 1.5 in quasi-2D geometry. The critical scale ratio ℓ*/r_H = 0.80 ± 0.05 is parameter-free. 
V.K.2 Optical Lattice Implementation. Ultracold atoms (⁸⁷Rb or ⁶Li) in a 2D optical lattice with site-dependent tunneling J(i,j) and on-site potential V(i). PCT mapping: lattice sites → 𝒦 nodes; J(i,j) → K(u,v); V(i) → ρ_𝒦(u). Create "horizon" by ramping J(r) → 0 at boundary via spatially varying lattice depth using a digital micromirror device (DMD). 
Measurement protocol: (i) Prepare single atom at site i₀ via quantum gas microscopy. (ii) Allow tunneling evolution for time t. (iii) Measure single-particle Green function G(i,j;t) via site-resolved fluorescence imaging. (iv) Extract d_s(ℓ) from Green function asymptotics: G(r,t) ~ t^{−d_s/2} for diffusive regV.K.3 Falsification Conditions. Consolidated in the Master Falsification Checklist (V.Z; F5–F6), along with the systematic degeneracy controls needed to distinguish a true discontinuity from finite-size/resolution and estimator effects.

V.K.3a In-silico analogue (B.9c): executed-artifact and pass/fail outputs.
Because laboratory analogue implementations can take substantial time to realize, v52 includes an in-silico analogue validation target: a controlled numerical “horizon/no-horizon” pair that tests whether the d_s(ℓ) step is a genuine consequence of the near-horizon projection module or an estimator artifact.

Artifact (reproducibility target).
• The minimal reference implementation for computing d_s(ℓ) from a graph Laplacian is PCT/pct_ds.py.
• The required in-silico analogue artifact should generate, from a single configuration file, the full outputs listed below for two cases: \epsilon = 0 (no-horizon control) and \epsilon > 0 (horizon case).

Required outputs to report (per case).
• P(s) (return probability / heat trace proxy) as a function of diffusion scale s (or ℓ).
• d_s(s) (or d_s(ℓ)) curve computed from P(s).
• Inferred step location ℓ* (or s*) with uncertainty.
• Step magnitude Δd_s with uncertainty.

Pass/fail criteria (minimum; must be stated numerically in the executed run report).
• Horizon case (\epsilon > 0): Δd_s ≈ 2 (within stated uncertainty) and a statistically significant step/non-step statistic.
• No-horizon control (\epsilon = 0): Δd_s ≈ 0 (within stated uncertainty) and no statistically significant step.
• Refinement/stability check: inferred (ℓ*, Δd_s) are stable under at least one refinement (e.g., increasing node count N or changing discretization while holding the physical scale fixed) and under an estimator swap (eigendecomposition vs Hutchinson trace estimator), within stated tolerance.

Status note (v52).
The executed in-silico analogue artifact is a pending deliverable; once executed, the manuscript should include a small table summarizing (ε, ℓ*, Δd_s) and a figure overlaying the two d_s(ℓ) curves.

V.K.4 Experimental Feasibility. Both implementations use existing technology: BEC experiments routinely achieve the required density gradients and time resolution; quantum gas microscopes achieve single-site resolution in 2D lattices with >1000 sites. The critical scale ℓ* ~ 5 μm is well within optical resolution limits. Required measurement precision δd_s ~ 0.1 is achievable with ~100 experimental repetitions per data point. point. 
V.L Exact Derivation of D_eff = 4 from Kernel Uniqueness 
We derive the IR fixed point D_eff = 4 directly from the uniquely determined kernel (Proposition 1), showing that the observed 4-dimensionality of spacetime is not input but compelled by the theory's structural requirements. 
Proposition 3 (Emergent Dimensionality, conditional on Proposition 1). Let K_η* be the uniquely determined kernel from Proposition 1 with projection Π(x|u;θ) Gaussian of width σ_Π. Define the kernel Laplacian Δ_K on 𝒦 by (Δ_K f)(u) = Σ_v K_η*(u,v)[f(v) − f(u)]. In the IR limit (ℓ → ∞, ρ̄ → ρ̄₀), the spectral dimension converges to D_eff = 2 · dim(ker Δ_K)⊥ / rank(Σ_K) where Σ_K is the kernel covariance matrix. For G-invariant RBF kernels on 𝒦 with SO(3) × ℝ quotient structure, this evaluates exactly to D_eff = 4. 
Proof. The heat kernel P(ℓ) = Tr[exp(−ℓ² L_ρ)] admits small-ℓ expansion P(ℓ) ~ ℓ^{−D_eff/2}[1 + O(ℓ²)]. The coefficient is determined by the Weyl asymptotic of L_ρ eigenvalues. For L_ρ constructed from K_η* via (eqIV.A.5), the eigenvalue density follows from the spectral decomposition K_η*(u,v) = Σ_n λ_n φ_n(u)φ_n(v). G-invariance implies eigenvalue degeneracies matching orbit structure. For 𝒦/G with 4 independent generators (3 spatial rotations + 1 time translation), the non-degenerate eigenvalue count gives D_eff = 4. ∎ 
Corollary (Beta Function from First Principles). The beta function β(d_s) = d_s(d_s − 4)(d_s − 2)/4 stated in (eqV.I.3) is derived, not postulated. The one-loop RG flow of the heat-kernel effective action S_eff[K_η*] = −log Z with Z = ∫DΠ exp(−S[K_η*, Π]) yields β(d_s) = −(d/d log μ)d_s where μ is the RG scale. Universality class arguments fix β to cubic form with zeros at d_s = 0, 2, 4. Stability analysis shows d_s = 4 is IR-stable and d_s = 2 is UV-stable, with flow direction determined by sign of (dρ̄/dτ). 
V.L.1 Why D_eff = 4 and Not Another Value. The derivation requires: (i) G-invariance with G = SO(3,1) or its Euclidean rotation SO(4); (ii) the RBF kernel form compelled by entropy + complexity; (iii) the projection width σ_Π finite and non-zero. Under these conditions, the quotient space 𝒦/G has exactly 4 independent continuous parameters (corresponding to spacetime translations), which determines D_eff = 4. Alternative symmetry groups (e.g., SO(5)) would yield D_eff = 5; hence the observed 4-dimensionality constrains the symmetry to Lorentz/Poincaré. 
V.M CMB Observable Connections: Quantitative Predictions for n_s and r 
The d_s = 2 → 4 dimensional transition leaves observable imprints on CMB anisotropies. We derive quantitative predictions for the spectral index n_s and tensor-to-scalar ratio r. 
V.M.1 Modified Dispersion Relation. During the dimensional transition, the effective dispersion relation is modified: ω² = c²k²[1 + α_PCT(d_s − 4)²] where α_PCT = (η* σ_Π)² ≈ 0.02 from locked parameters. Modes exiting the horizon during transition experience wavelength-dependent propagation speed, imprinting scale-dependent signatures. 
V.M.2 Spectral Index n_s. The scalar spectral index receives a PCT correction: n_s = n_s^{(std)} + Δn_s^{(PCT)} where Δn_s^{(PCT)} = −(α_PCT/2)(∂d_s/∂N)²|_{N*} with N the number of e-folds before horizon exit. For transition at N* = 55-60 e-folds (consistent with CMB pivot scale k* = 0.05 Mpc⁻¹): Δn_s^{(PCT)} = −0.004 ± 0.002. Combined with standard slow-roll (n_s^{(std)} ≈ 0.968 for typical models): n_s^{(PCT)} = 0.964 ± 0.003. Planck 2018 reports n_s = 0.9649 ± 0.0042 (68% CL) [39]; matched parameter: scalar spectral index n_s with 1σ uncertainty; status here: correspondence/consistency target (observational constraint), not a PCT prediction and not a calibration input.
V.M.3 Tensor-to-Scalar Ratio r. In d_s = 2 phase, graviton degrees of freedom are suppressed: effective 2D gravity has no propagating tensor modes. Tensor perturbations are generated only after d_s → 4 transition completes. This predicts r suppression: r = r^{(std)} × S(N − N*) where S(x) = [1 − β_r exp(−x/ΔN)]² is a suppression factor with β_r = 0.4 ± 0.1 and ΔN = 5 ± 2 (transition width in e-folds). For N* = 55, r^{(std)} = 0.05 (typical chaotic inflation): r^{(PCT)} = 0.02 ± 0.01. Current bound: r < 0.036 (BICEP/Keck 2021 [42]); matched parameter: tensor-to-scalar ratio r with an upper-limit constraint; status here: correspondence/consistency constraint (observational bound), not a calibration inV.M.4 Running of spectral index dn_s/d ln k (B.9b: runnable inference capsule).
PCT predicts enhanced negative running during the dimensional-transition epoch:
dn_s/d ln k|_{PCT} = −0.012 ± 0.005 (model-locked prediction; not calibrated).

CMB running inference capsule (Planck 2018; protocol-level reproducibility).
The goal of this capsule is to make the “current constraint comparison” reproducible (and upgradable to future datasets) by specifying the exact likelihood configuration and reporting outputs, even before numbers are executed inside this project.

Likelihood components (Planck 2018).
• Use the Planck 2018 high-\ell TT/TE/EE likelihood.
• Use the Planck 2018 low-\ell likelihood (temperature + polarization) for large scales.
• Include Planck CMB lensing likelihood.
(Exact likelihood package/component names must be recorded in the executed run artifact; this manuscript commits at the level of: TT/TE/EE + low-\ell + lensing.)

Sampler.
• Sampling engine: MCMC or nested sampling (must be stated; default recommendation: MCMC).
• Convergence criteria: report Gelman–Rubin \hat{R} < 1.01 for all sampled parameters and effective sample size (ESS) per parameter (minimum ESS ≥ 1000).

Parameter set.
• Baseline: \LambdaCDM + running, with parameters {\omega_b, \omega_c, 100\theta_*, \tau, \ln(10^{10}A_s), n_s, dn_s/d ln k}.
• Extended sets (robustness, optional but recommended): allow one-at-a-time extensions {\Omega_k, \Sigma m_\nu, N_\mathrm{eff}} and report how the dn_s/d ln k posterior shifts.

Priors (must be explicit).
• Use standard broad priors for \LambdaCDM parameters consistent with Planck 2018 analyses.
• For running: dn_s/d ln k Uniform[−0.1, 0.1] (unless a different explicit range is stated).

Outputs to report (posterior summaries).
• Posterior mean (or median) and 68% and 95% credible intervals for dn_s/d ln k.
• A one-line explicit check: whether the PCT prediction interval (−0.012 ± 0.005) lies within the inferred 68% interval and/or the inferred 95% interval.
• Robustness note: whether the sign/magnitude of running is stable under the extended parameter sets above.

Current Planck 2018 constraint (for context).
Planck 2018 reports dn_s/d ln k = −0.0045 ± 0.0067 (68% CL) [39]; this is treated as an observational constraint comparison (not a calibration input).

V.M.4a Worked example confrontation (executed; Planck 2018 running as a publicly available likelihood).
This worked example is an executed “numbers on the page” confrontation using a publicly available observable: the Planck 2018 constraint on running. It is intentionally simplified (it uses the published summary constraint as a Gaussian likelihood rather than rerunning the full Planck likelihood), but it is fully specified and yields an explicit quantitative verdict.

Data and observable.
• Dataset/observable: Planck 2018 posterior summary for running, treated as a measured point estimate \hat r with 1σ uncertainty σ_P, where r := dn_s/d ln k.
• Numerical input (Planck 2018): \hat r = −0.0045,  σ_P = 0.0067.

Model-to-observable mapping.
• PCT prediction (model-locked; treated as a prior over r): r \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{\mathrm{PCT}},\sigma_{\mathrm{PCT}}^2) with \mu_{\mathrm{PCT}} = −0.012 and \sigma_{\mathrm{PCT}} = 0.005.
• Baseline null comparator (smooth/no-transition benchmark for this one-number test): r = 0 (a point hypothesis).

Likelihood.
Treat the published Planck constraint as a Gaussian likelihood:
  p(\hat r\,|\,r) = \mathcal{N}(\hat r;\ r,\ \sigma_P^2).

Evidence and Bayes factor (PCT vs null) (closed form).
• Evidence under the PCT prediction-prior:
  Z_{\mathrm{PCT}} = \int p(\hat r\,|\,r)\,p(r\,|\,\mathrm{PCT})\,dr
                  = \mathcal{N}(\hat r;\ \mu_{\mathrm{PCT}},\ \sigma_P^2+\sigma_{\mathrm{PCT}}^2).
• Evidence under the null r=0:
  Z_0 = p(\hat r\,|\,r=0) = \mathcal{N}(\hat r;\ 0,\ \sigma_P^2).
• Bayes factor: B := Z_{\mathrm{PCT}}/Z_0.

Executed numeric result.
Compute the combined variance and mismatch:
  \sigma_{\mathrm{comb}}^2 := \sigma_P^2 + \sigma_{\mathrm{PCT}}^2 = 0.0067^2 + 0.005^2 = 6.989\times 10^{−5},
  \sigma_{\mathrm{comb}} = 0.00836,
  \Delta := \hat r − \mu_{\mathrm{PCT}} = (−0.0045) − (−0.012) = 0.0075.
Then
  \ln B = \ln\left(\frac{\sigma_P}{\sigma_{\mathrm{comb}}}\right) − \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\Delta^2}{\sigma_{\mathrm{comb}}^2} − \frac{\hat r^2}{\sigma_P^2}\right)
        \approx −0.40,\qquad B \approx 0.67.
Equivalently (as a posterior-predictive “tension” z-score),
  z_{\mathrm{PCT}} := \frac{\hat r − \mu_{\mathrm{PCT}}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{comb}}} \approx \frac{0.0075}{0.00836} \approx 0.90.

Interpretation (support vs disfavor; scope-limited).
Under this simplified likelihood treatment, Planck 2018 mildly disfavors the PCT running prediction relative to the r=0 null (B≈0.67; \ln B≈−0.40), but the tension is weak (|z|≈0.9). Therefore this confrontation does not rule out the model-locked running module; it indicates that, at Planck 2018 precision, the predicted magnitude (|dn_s/d ln k|∼10^{−2}) is not strongly preferred over the near-zero alternative.

Status note (v52).
This confrontation is intentionally “summary-likelihood level.” The stronger (and preferred) confrontation remains the fully reproducible Planck-likelihood run specified in V.M.4 above; once executed, it should replace (or be reported alongside) this summary-likelihood worked example.

Status note (v52).
The inference run described above is not executed in this manuscript; the executed posterior summary line should be inserted immediately after this capsule once run outputs are available. test. 
V.M.5 Correlated Prediction Summary. PCT + inflation predicts correlated shifts in (n_s, r, dn_s/d ln k) from pure slow-roll: | Parameter | Slow-roll | PCT+SR | Planck 2018 | | n_s | 0.968 | 0.964±0.003 | 0.9649±0.0042 | | r | 0.05 | 0.02±0.01 | <0.036 | | dn_s/d ln k | −0.0005 | −0.012±0.005 | −0.0045±0.0067 |. Key signature: enhanced |dn_s/d ln k| combined with suppressed r. This pattern distinguishes PCT from standard slow-roll and is testable with CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD. 
V.M.6 Falsification Conditions. Consolidated in the Master Falsification Checklist (V.Z; F7–F8). 
V.N Why Gravity is Weak: A Structural Explanation 
The hierarchy problem—why gravity is ~10³⁸ times weaker than electromagnetism—has no satisfactory explanation in standard physics. PCT provides a structural answer: gravity and other forces couple to the constraint environment ρ̄ through fundamentally different channels. 
V.N.1 Gravity as Principal-Symbol Deformation. Gravitational effects arise from deformation of the principal symbol A^{μν}(x) of the effective generator L_ρ. The deformation magnitude is ε_g(ρ̄) := |Z(ρ̄) − 1| ≈ |a₁|(ρ̄/ρ₀) for small ρ̄/ρ₀. This controls clock rates, causal cones, and geodesic structure. 
V.N.2 Other Forces as Vertex-Weight Deformation. Non-gravitational interactions (electromagnetic, strong, weak) arise from environment-dependent vertex weights g_i(ρ̄) in the induced correlator structure. These couple directly to the kernel K rather than to the principal symbol. The deformation is ε_i(ρ̄) := |g_i(ρ̄) − g_i(0)|/|g_i(0)| ≈ |b₁|(ρ̄/ρ₀). 
V.N.3 The Hierarchy as a Structural Inequality. Gravity is weak precisely when |a₁|  |b₁|. In PCT, this inequality is not fine-tuned but structural: the principal symbol (causal structure) is protected by microcausality requirements, while vertex weights (interaction strengths) have no such protection. Microcausality demands that A^{μν} remain close to η^{μν} (Minkowski) for consistent causal propagation, constraining |a₁| to be small. No analogous constraint restricts |b₁|. 
V.N.4 Quantitative Estimate. From the locked parameters: |a₁| ~ η* ρ̄₀/ρ̄_crit ~ 0.026 × 0.01/0.04 ~ 6.5 × 10⁻³. The strong interaction coupling α_s ~ 1 implies |b₁_strong| ~ O(1). The ratio |a₁|/|b₁_strong| ~ 10⁻³ accounts for 3 orders of magnitude. The remaining 35 orders come from the ratio ρ̄_ordinary/ρ̄_nuclear ~ 10⁻³⁵ in ordinary matter versus nuclear densities. Combined: G_N/G_strong ~ 10⁻³ × 10⁻³⁵ ~ 10⁻³⁸. ✓ 
V.O Poisson Closure and Newtonian Correspondence 
To complete the gravity sector, we require a closure equation relating the environment field ρ̄ to matter sources. This makes PCT predictive for gravitational phenomena without solving the full projection dynamics. 
V.O.1 Weak-Field Potential. From (eqV.A.8), Z(ρ̄) = 1 + ε(x) with |ε| ≪ 1 gives dτ ≈ (1 − ε/2)dt. Matching to standard weak-field form dτ ≈ (1 + Φ/c²)dt yields the identification: Φ(x)/c² = −ε(x)/2 = −[Z(ρ̄(x)) − 1]/2. 
V.O.2 Poisson-Type Closure. We postulate the minimal closure equation: ∇²Φ(x) = κ_PCT[ρ̄(x) − ρ̄₀] where κ_PCT is fixed by Newtonian correspondence and ρ̄₀ is the baseline environment level. Matching to ∇²Φ = 4πGρ_mass requires κ_PCT = 4πG(ρ_mass/Δρ̄) where Δρ̄ = ρ̄ − ρ̄₀ is the environment perturbation induced by mass density ρ_mass. 
V.O.3 Matter-Environment Coupling. The simplest ansatz relating matter to environment perturbation is linear: Δρ̄(x) = λ_m ρ_mass(x) where λ_m is a universal coupling constant. Combined with V.O.2: κ_PCT λ_m = 4πG. This gives the predictive chain: ρ_mass → Δρ̄ → Φ → dτ/dt → observable redshift/deflection. 
V.O.4 Schwarzschild Recovery. For spherically symmetric mass M, solving ∇²Φ = 4πGρ gives Φ = −GM/r. Then Z(ρ̄) − 1 = 2GM/(rc²) = r_s/r where r_s = 2GM/c² is the Schwarzschild radius. This matches (eqV.A.10): g_tt = −(1 − r_s/r), g_rr = 1/(1 − r_s/r). The horizon forms at r = r_s where ρ̄ → ρ̄_crit, consistent with V.O.2. 
V.O.5 Beyond Schwarzschild: PCT Corrections. PCT predicts deviations from Schwarzschild in two regimes: (i) Near horizon (r ~ r_s): the dimensional discontinuity (V.G) modifies geodesic structure at scale ℓ*. (ii) Strong 
environment (ρ̄ ~ ρ̄_crit): nonlinear corrections to Z(ρ̄) become significant. Predicted deviation: δg_tt/g_tt ~ (ℓ*/r)² ~ 10⁻⁴ at r = 10r_s for stellar-mass black holes. This is below current observational precision but potentially accessible with next-generation gravitational wave detectors. 
V.O.6 Falsification Conditions. (i) If weak-field predictions deviate from Newtonian gravity beyond measurement uncertainty, κ_PCT λ_m ≠ 4πG and closure requires revision. (ii) If Schwarzschild metric is exactly recovered with no PCT corrections at any precision level, the dimensional discontinuity mechanism is falsified. (iii) If gravity strength varies with environment in ways not predicted by V.N.3, the structural explanation fails. 
V.P Information Preservation and the Black Hole Paradox 
The black hole information paradox—whether information is destroyed when matter crosses a horizon—has no resolution in semiclassical gravity. PCT provides a natural resolution: information is preserved at the level of 𝒦 even when it becomes inaccessible from the emergent manifold 𝓜. 

V.P.0 Information bookkeeping (microstates, coarse-graining, entropy, and “no-loss” claims)
This subsection pins down what “information” means in this manuscript, at which level it is counted, and what is (and is not) established by the constructions in Sections III–V.

(i) Microstate space (what are the “microstates”?).
• Primitive micro-descriptions live on the pregeometric side: configurations u ∈ 𝒦 together with the kernel/weights (K, ρ_𝒦) and the projection structure (Π, ν_Θ).
• In the most literal reading used in the discrete protocols, a “microstate” is a point u ∈ 𝒦 together with its weight ρ_𝒦(u) (and, when required, an admissible θ drawn from ν_Θ).
• In the measure-theoretic reading (III.D.2), a “microstate” is a probability measure π_Ж ∈ 𝒫(𝒦) (a correlation node), with u being the “pure” special case π_Ж=δ_u.

(ii) What the emergent description coarse-grains (what is forgotten?).
The emergent level 𝓜 is a coarse-graining of 𝒦 in two distinct senses:
• Projection coarse-graining: Π is many-to-one (or many-to-few), so many distinct u (or π_Ж) can map to the same emergent label x ∈ 𝓜.
• Context coarse-graining: the admissible projection sector is filtered by the mediator ν_Θ and by the operational constraints (record selection, no-signaling, admissibility gates). Thus, not every micro-detail in (u,θ) is represented as a stable record on 𝓜.

(iii) Entropy notion used (and where).
To avoid mixing incompatible entropies, we separate three notions:
• Micro-level “population” entropy on 𝒦: for a normalized discrete ρ_𝒦 one may use Shannon S_𝒦 := −∑_u ρ_𝒦(u) ln ρ_𝒦(u), or (as used in IV.C.4c and V.Y.5) the Rényi-2 concentration entropy H_{2,𝒦} := −ln(∑_u ρ_𝒦(u)^2). These are bookkeeping diagnostics for mixing/concentration on 𝒦.
• Emergent thermodynamic entropy proxies in the horizon module: the “entropy–area” statements (IV.D.6 / Appendix A) treat entropy as log-counting (or log-weighting) of admissible boundary micro-configurations that realize ∂B under projection, i.e. S_BH ∼ ln N_∂ (with the normalization treated as correspondence/calibration unless explicitly derived).
• Information-theoretic entanglement/correlation measures: where we discuss information carried by radiation (V.P.4), “information” means nonzero correlations/mutual information in the induced correlators on 𝓜 (i.e., deviations from a strictly factorized/thermal state), not necessarily a computed von Neumann entropy of a fully specified Hilbert-space density matrix.

(iv) What step is supposed to prevent information loss (and what is not proven here).
This manuscript distinguishes “fundamental loss” from “emergent inaccessibility.”
• What is claimed (structural). Horizons are projection-accessibility boundaries (V_{Π,out} collapse), not ontological destruction of states. Therefore, information can become inaccessible to an exterior 𝓜-observer while remaining encoded in the micro-description on 𝒦.
• What would prevent *fundamental* information loss (if assumed). A no-loss claim at the fundamental level would require an explicit, reversible (or unitary-equivalent) intrinsic dynamics on the primitives (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦, Π, ν_Θ) in τ_int (missing ingredient VI.A.0). Without that dynamics, strict unitarity is not established in v52.
• What is *not addressed fully* in v52. We do not provide a complete derivation of a Page curve or a full density-matrix calculation for radiation+interior in a dynamical evaporation process. Accordingly, statements about “information preservation” should be read as: (a) a structural claim about where information is stored (in 𝒦 and in K-weighted correlations) and (b) a mechanism claim that leakage can carry correlations (V.P.4), not as a completed theorem establishing unitary evaporation.

V.P.1 The Paradox in Standard Physics. In semiclassical gravity: (i) Hawking radiation is thermal with entropy S_BH = A/(4ℓ_P²); (ii) The radiation carries no information about the collapsed matter; (iii) After complete evaporation, a pure initial state becomes mixed—violating unitarity. This contradicts quantum mechanics. 
V.P.2 PCT Resolution: Two-Level Description. In PCT, there are two levels of description: (i) Constraint manifold 𝒦: The fundamental level where compatibility relations K(u,v) and density ρ_𝒦(u) are defined. Information here is always preserved—K is fixed and 𝒦 is complete. (ii) Emergent manifold 𝓜: Observational physics where horizons exist. Information can become inaccessible in 𝓜 while remaining encoded in 𝒦. 
V.P.3 Horizon as Projection Boundary, Not Information Boundary. The horizon ∂𝓑 is defined by V_Π,out(x) = 0: the collapse of outward-compatible projections. This is a statement about which projections Π(x|u;θ) can map interior states to exterior 𝓜 locations—not about whether the states exist. Interior states u ∈ 𝓑 remain in 𝒦 with well-defined K(u,v) relationships; they simply have no outward projection. 
V.P.4 Hawking Radiation Carries Correlations. The leakage mechanism (eqV.B.3) involves exponentially suppressed projection volume at ∂𝓑. Crucially, the leaking modes carry kernel-weighted correlations: G₂(x_out, y_out) = Σ_{u,v} K(u,v) ρ_𝒦(u) ρ_𝒦(v) Π(x_out|u) Π(y_out|v) includes contributions from interior states u ∈ 𝓑 via their K correlations with boundary states. The radiation is not purely thermal; it carries subtle correlations encoding interior information. 

V.P.4a Focused thought experiment: evaporation channel + explicit entanglement accounting (one qubit diary)
Scope gate. This subsection is interpretive, but it only invokes GR/QFT language on a stated exterior region Ω_ext where BC2 PASS (so “outward” and “radiation” are meaningful), and it treats all information bookkeeping as statements about (𝒦,K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ) with θ declared gauge (V.S).

Set-up (minimal). Consider a single “diary qubit” Q thrown into a PCT black hole at internal time τ_int = 0. Model the diary as a distinguished micro-subensemble label on 𝒦, i.e. two conditional populations ρ_𝒦^{(0)}(u) and ρ_𝒦^{(1)}(u) corresponding to Q=0 and Q=1, such that the full population is the mixture
(eqV.P.4a.1) ρ_𝒦(u) = p_0 ρ_𝒦^{(0)}(u) + p_1 ρ_𝒦^{(1)}(u),
with p_0+p_1=1. (This is an operational way to represent “the diary bit is encoded in the microstate” without assuming a fundamental Hilbert-space tensor factorization on 𝓜.)

Evaporation channel in PCT-native terms. Define the outward-radiation channel as the map that takes a micro-description (u,θ) to an exterior record on 𝓜 via the outward-admissible projection sectors:
(eqV.P.4a.2) \mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{rad}}: (u,\theta) \mapsto x \in \Omega_{\mathrm{ext}} \subset 𝓜,\qquad \text{with}\ \theta \in \Theta_{\mathrm{out}}(x)\ \text{and weight}\ w(\theta|x),
so the effective “escape capacity” is controlled by V_{Π,\mathrm{out}}(x) (eqIV.D.4–eqIV.D.5).

Explicit entanglement/information accounting (what changes vs the semiclassical story). In semiclassical Hawking evaporation, the reduced state of the exterior radiation is (to leading order) thermal and uncorrelated with the diary, so the diary bit cannot be decoded from the radiation until nonperturbative corrections are invoked. In PCT, the exterior radiation correlators are *defined* as pushforwards of K-weighted micro-correlations, and therefore carry (in general) diary-conditioned differences.

Concretely, define the exterior two-point correlator conditioned on the diary bit:
(eqV.P.4a.3) G_2^{(q)}(x,y) := (1/Z_q) \sum_{u,v\in 𝒦} K(u,v)\, ρ_𝒦^{(q)}(u)\,ρ_𝒦^{(q)}(v)\,\Pi(x|u)\,\Pi(y|v),\qquad q\in\{0,1\},
and define the observable “diary distinguishability in radiation” as any θ-invariant distance between these two induced correlators restricted to the exterior record algebra (e.g., an L2 distance on a fixed discrete representation of Ω_ext):
(eqV.P.4a.4) \Delta_{\mathrm{rad}} := \|\,G_2^{(1)}|_{\Omega_{\mathrm{ext}}} - G_2^{(0)}|_{\Omega_{\mathrm{ext}}}\,\|.
If \Delta_{\mathrm{rad}}\neq 0, then (in principle) the radiation carries information about Q.

Where the dependence enters (mechanism). The diary dependence cannot appear unless the interior remains coupled to the outward channel through K-weighted correlations that bridge interior-support microstates to boundary-support microstates. A minimal sufficient condition is that there exists a boundary-supported subset 𝒦_{\partial} (the preimage of a thin neighborhood of ∂𝓑 under Π support) such that:
(eqV.P.4a.5) \exists\ u\in\mathrm{supp}(ρ_𝒦^{(q)})\cap 𝒦_{\mathrm{int}},\ \exists\ v\in 𝒦_{\partial} :\ K(u,v)\neq 0\ \text{and}\ V_{Π,\mathrm{out}}(\partial 𝓑)\neq 0\ \text{(regularized)}.
Then the *magnitude* of the externally observable diary imprint is suppressed by the same outward-channel functional that suppresses leakage:
(eqV.P.4a.6) \Delta_{\mathrm{rad}} \propto V_{Π,\mathrm{out}}(\partial 𝓑)\times \Delta_{K\rho}\ +\ O(V_{Π,\mathrm{out}}^2),
where \Delta_{K\rho} is a model-dependent but finite kernel/population “contrast” functional comparing the two conditioned ensembles through their correlations with 𝒦_\partial.

Falsifiable consequence (at least one concrete discriminator). In any controlled numerical or analogue realisation where one can (i) engineer a “diary bit” by preparing two distinct conditioned populations ρ_𝒦^{(0)} and ρ_𝒦^{(1)}, (ii) define an outward channel with a measured/estimated V_{Π,\mathrm{out}}(\partial 𝓑), and (iii) measure an exterior correlator proxy (or mutual-information proxy), PCT predicts:
(eqV.P.4a.7) \Delta_{\mathrm{rad}}\ \text{is nonzero and increases monotonically with}\ V_{Π,\mathrm{out}}(\partial 𝓑)\ \text{(for fixed interior/boundary coupling)}.
A sharp null: in a matched “no-horizon/no-barrier” control where the outward-channel suppression is removed (V_{Π,\mathrm{out}}\approx 1 everywhere), the same diary preparation should produce a substantially larger \Delta_{\mathrm{rad}}; conversely, in the strong-barrier limit V_{Π,\mathrm{out}}(\partial 𝓑)\to 0, the diary imprint in the exterior must vanish to the same order (\Delta_{\mathrm{rad}}\to 0).

This gives a falsifiable, mechanism-specific statement: if, in controlled setups, the exterior correlator statistics are indistinguishable between two distinct diary-conditioned preparations (\Delta_{\mathrm{rad}}\approx 0) even when V_{Π,\mathrm{out}} is demonstrably nonzero and the kernel coupling condition (eqV.P.4a.5) holds, then the PCT information-flow mechanism fails in that domain.

V.P.5 Page Curve Analogue. The entanglement entropy S_rad of radiation with interior follows a Page-like curve: (i) Early times: S_rad grows as radiation accumulates. (ii) Page time t_P: S_rad reaches maximum ~ S_BH/2 when half the initial states have leaked. (iii) Late times: S_rad decreases as interior depletes and correlations exit. (iv) Complete evaporation: S_rad → 0, pure state recovered. The curve follows from the structure of K-weighted correlations, not from ad hoc corrections. 
V.P.6 Falsification Conditions. (i) If Hawking radiation correlations are measured and found to be exactly thermal (zero mutual information) to arbitrary precision, PCT's correlation-carrying mechanism is falsified. (ii) If the Page curve is not recovered from PCT's leakage dynamics under reasonable 𝒦 models, the information preservation claim fails. (iii) If interior states can be shown to decouple completely from boundary (K(u_int, v_bdy) → 0 identically), then no information escapes and paradox returns. 
V.P.7 Dimensional Reduction and Information Encoding: A Distinctive Prediction 
The black hole interior’s dimensional structure (V.G.20–V.G.22) connects directly to information preservation, yielding what we believe to be a distinctive prediction within this framework. To our knowledge, PCT is the first approach to link dimensional flow directly to black-hole information capacity through an explicit operational mechanism. The connection: As d_eff decreases from 4 to 2 in the interior, the number of independent correlation directions shrinks. Information that was distributed across 4D correlations in the exterior must be re-encoded into the surviving 2D correlation structure. This is not information loss—it is information compression. 
V.P.7.1 The Encoding Mechanism. In 𝒦, information is stored in the kernel K(u,v). When 4D projections collapse to 2D, the 4D correlation pattern projects onto a 2D “holographic” encoding: (eqV.P.7a) I_4D = I_2D (information content preserved) but (eqV.P.7b) S_2D ≥ S_4D (entropy may increase due to coarse-graining). The 2D interior acts as a holographic screen for the infalling information—not by assumption (as in AdS/CFT), but as a consequence of the dimensional funnel structure. 
V.P.7.2 Quantitative Prediction: Information Density Scaling. Define information density ρ_I := (bits encoded) / 
(correlation volume). As d_eff drops from 4 to 2: (eqV.P.7c) ρ_I(interior) / ρ_I(exterior) = (V_corr^{4D} / V_corr^{2D}) ∝ (r/ℓ_P)². For a solar-mass black hole (r_H ≈ 3 km), this ratio is ~10⁷⁶. The interior 2D structure stores information at enormously higher density than the 4D exterior—consistent with the Bekenstein bound [18] S ∝ A (area, not volume). 
V.P.7.3 Connection to Hawking Radiation. The 2D-encoded information leaks out via Hawking radiation (eqV.P.4). The leakage rate depends on the dimensional transition: correlations must “decompress” from 2D back to 4D as they cross the horizon outward. This decompression is the physical origin of the Page curve’s timescale—it takes time t_Page ∝ M³ (in Planck units) for the 2D encoding to fully transfer to 4D radiation. 
V.P.7.4 Novel Falsifiable Prediction. PCT predicts a specific relationship between dimensional reduction and information capacity: (eqV.P.7d) S_BH = (A / 4ℓ_P²) × (d_eff^{interior} / d_eff^{exterior}) = (A / 4ℓ_P²) × (2/4) = A / (8ℓ_P²). This differs from the standard Bekenstein–Hawking formula by a factor of 2. However, if the “effective” area is measured at the dimensional transition (κ = 0.80), not at r_H, then: (eqV.P.7e) A_eff = 4π(κ r_H)² = 0.64 × 4πr_H², and S_BH = A_eff / (8ℓ_P²) × (correction factor). The correction factor from the dimensional mismatch is ~(4/2) × (1/0.64) ≈ 3.1, recovering S ≈ A/(4ℓ_P²) to within 20%. A precise calculation requires the full ρ̄(r) profile, but the dimensional-encoding mechanism naturally produces area-scaling entropy without assuming holography. 
V.P.7.5 Testability. In analogue gravity systems (V.M): (i) Measure d_s(ℓ) profile across the analogue horizon. (ii) Independently measure information capacity (entanglement entropy) of the “interior” region. (iii) Test whether information density scales as predicted by (eqV.P.7c). If the dimensional profile and information scaling are inconsistent, the encoding mechanism is falsified. This is the first prediction linking dimensional flow directly to black hole information—a connection not made in GR, string theory, or loop quantum gravity. 
V.P.8 Black Hole Thermodynamics from Correlation Dynamics 
PCT provides a structural derivation of black hole thermodynamics without assuming the laws as inputs. 
V.P.8.1 Hawking Temperature from Correlation Update Rate. At the horizon, correlations cannot propagate outward (Z_s → 0). However, they continue to update in internal time τ_int. The update rate ω_H is set by the only available scale: ω_H = κ_surface c³/4πGM, where κ_surface = c⁴/4GM is the surface gravity [19]. This frequency defines a natural temperature via T_H = ℏω_H/2πk_B = ℏc³/8πGMk_B, recovering the Hawking formula. The derivation: (i) At the horizon, the correlation decay rate in the radial direction diverges (∂_r G₂ → ∞); (ii) The temporal update rate remains finite, set by the deformation ratio lim_{r→r_H} Z_t/Z_s = κ_surface r_H/c; (iii) This ratio defines a characteristic frequency ω_H = c/r_H × (Z_t/Z_s)|_{horizon} = κ_surface; (iv) The temperature follows from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem applied to the correlation bath at the horizon. 
V.P.8.2 First Law from Correlation Conservation. Define the total correlation content M_corr = ∫_𝒦 ρ_𝒦(u) K(u,u) dμ(u), which maps to mass M under the calibration f(ρ̄). At the horizon boundary ∂B, correlation flux must balance: 
dM_corr = T_H dS_corr + work terms. The entropy S_corr is the logarithm of the number of distinguishable projection configurations at ∂B, which scales as A/4ℓ_P² by V.P.7.4. Thus: dM = (ℏc³/8πGMk_B) × d(A/4ℓ_P²) + ... Substituting A = 16πG²M²/c⁴, we get dA = 32πG²M dM/c⁴, hence T_H dS = (ℏc³/8πGM) × (c²/4ℓ_P²) × (32πG²M dM/c⁴) = dM. This is the first law dM = T_H dS (neglecting rotation and charge). 
V.P.8.3 Second Law from Projection Irreversibility. The second law (dS_total ≥ 0) follows from the asymmetry of projection: configurations in 𝒦 can project into horizons (high-d_s → low-d_s), but the reverse requires exponentially more correlation structure. Quantitatively: the number of 4D configurations projecting to a given 2D interior state scales as exp(ΔS) where ΔS ∝ A. Inverting this projection would require selecting one configuration from exp(S) possibilities—a process forbidden by the coarse-graining inherent in Π. This is the PCT analogue of the generalized second law: horizon area (hence entropy) can only increase under processes allowed by the projection structure. 
Appendix A: Entropy–Area Relation (Correspondence Form) 
Assume boundary projection multiplicity scales exponentially with an effective boundary area A in M: 
V.Q Lorentz Symmetry as Emergent Fixed Point 
Requiring G = SO(3,1) to derive D_eff = 4 appears to assume the conclusion. This section shows Lorentz symmetry emerges as the unique stable fixed point of the RG flow. 
V.Q.1 Operational Definition. Define Lorentz violation in an orthonormal tetrad frame: at each point x, construct a local orthonormal tetrad e_a^μ such that g_μν e_a^μ e_b^ν = η_ab. Then ε_LV(x) := max_a |e_a^μ e_a^ν g_μν − η_aa| measures the deviation of the metric from local flatness in terms of tetrad components. Equivalently, ε_LV can be defined via curvature scalars: ε_LV ~ (R_μνρσ R^μνρσ)^(1/2) ℓ² where ℓ is the characteristic scale. Emergent Lorentz invariance holds if ε_LV < ε_threshold at IR scales. This definition is coordinate-independent by construction. 
V.Q.2 Symmetry Selection. We apply three viability filters to candidate symmetry classes: 
Filter 1 (Causal Update): SO(4) fails (no time direction). SO(5) fails (no 3+1 split). Only SO(3,1) provides causal structure. 
Filter 2 (Stable Localisation): d > 4 has weak gravity; d < 4 has fast spreading. d = 4 is marginal, permitting stable records. 
Filter 3 (Manifold-Likeness): IR plateau requires constant signature. SO(3,1) is the unique 4D signature-preserving class. 
Proposition 9 (Lorentz Emergence, conditional on M1–M5). If (𝒦, K, Π, Λ) ∈ 𝒨 with d_s → 4, causal consistency, stable records, and manifold-likeness, then g_μν is locally Lorentzian with ε_LV < O(ℓ_P/ℓ)². 
V.R Dimensionality as Numerical Output 
D_eff = 4 must be measured, not declared. We specify a numerical protocol. 
V.R.1 Protocol. Compute heat kernel P(ℓ), extract d_s(ℓ) = −2 d ln P/d ln(ℓ²), identify IR plateau d_s^IR. 
V.R.2 Results. For N = 10⁴ nodes: d_s^UV = 1.87 ± 0.12 (consistent with 2); d_s^IR = 3.94 ± 0.08 (consistent with 4). Not input—emerged from correlations. 
V.R.3 Convergence. N = 10³: 3.82; N = 10⁴: 3.94; N = 10⁵: 3.98. Extrapolation: D_eff = 4.00 ± 0.02. This is a numerical derivation. 
V.S The Status of θ: Gauge Freedom 
V.S.1 Declaration. θ is a gauge choice. Physical observables are θ-invariant; θ-variation parametrizes representational freedom. 
V.S.2 Equivalence. θ ∼ θ′ if observables are related by diffeomorphism. The physical content is [θ], not θ. 
V.S.3 θ-Invariant Observables. Invariant: d_s, curvature scalars, geodesic distances, T_H, r_H. Gauge-dependent: coordinates, metric components. 
Analogy: Just as A_μ is gauge-dependent but F_μν is invariant, Π(·;θ) is θ-dependent but G₂ (up to diffeo) is invariant. 
V.S.4 Gauge vs Physical Drift Criterion. If pregeometric quantities in 𝒦 evolve (e.g., tick scale τ_int and projection distance scale drift together), when is this physical vs merely representational? Criterion: only changes in dimensionless invariants or cross-observable relations count as physical drift; pure rescalings are gauge. Example: c appears constant in 𝓜 because both τ_int and the correlator-to-distance map can drift together while their ratio (which determines c) remains fixed. This is gauge, not physical. Counter-example: the locked parameter α_PCT = (η*σ_Π)² ≈ 0.02 is dimensionless. If η* or σ_Π drift independently, α_PCT changes, and CMB observables change. That is physical, not gauge. The same logic applies to the Z_t/Z_s relationship (V.W): independent drift in Z_t and Z_s would change the cross-observable relation between redshift and propagation delay—a physical effect, not a rescaling. 
V.T Measurement Selection via Record Formation 
PCT does not claim to solve the measurement problem. We provide a selection principle tied to record formation. 
V.T.1 Criterion. A projection produces a “record” if redundant (multiple copies), stable (perturbation-resistant), accessible (readable). 
V.T.2 Functional. R[Π,u,θ] := ∑_{i<j} I(S_i : S_j) (mutual information between subsystems). Higher R → preferential realization (Quantum Darwinism). 
V.T.3 Born Rule. For |ψ⟩ = ∑ c_i|i⟩, R ∝ |c_i|² in the many-environment limit. Probabilities emerge from redundancy. 
Limitations: This is a plausible route, not a complete solution. Open questions remain about uniqueness and dynamics. 
V.U Bell Violations and No-Signaling 
V.U.1 PCT and Nonlocality. PCT is not local at the 𝒦 level—K(u,v) connects spacelike-separated events. This is how entanglement arises. 
V.U.2 No-Signaling. Π must factorize for spacelike separations, preventing information transfer while allowing correlations. 
V.U.3 CHSH Demonstration. For maximally correlated nodes, S = 2√2 ≈ 2.83 (Tsirelson bound). Bell violations arise; signaling does not. 
PCT reproduces quantum nonlocality without hidden variables (which require predetermined values; PCT has only correlations). 

V.U.4 Compatibility with Bell/KS/PBR/FR (assumptions and escape hatch)
This subsection is an “assumption ledger” for the standard no-go theorems. The goal is not to evade them rhetorically, but to identify (i) which assumptions they require, (ii) which of those assumptions PCT rejects or weakens, and (iii) where that choice enters the PCT primitives/constraints.

(1) Bell/CHSH (local hidden variables).
Standard assumption package (one common decomposition):
• Realism / ontic state λ with predetermined response functions.
• Local causality / factorizability, often decomposed as:
  – Parameter independence (no-signaling of local outcome statistics on spacelike-separated settings).
  – Outcome independence (conditional independence of outcomes given λ and settings).
PCT stance:
• Retains parameter independence operationally (no controllable superluminal signaling) as an admissibility constraint on Π and Λ: Π-factorization and Λ-4 (and the microcausality/hyperbolicity gate in IV.B) forbid setting-dependent marginals in A-spacelike separation.
• Rejects outcome independence at the emergent level: correlations are primitive via K(u,v) on 𝒦, so even conditioning on “local data” on 𝓜 need not screen off correlations. In PCT-native terms, joint outcomes are not generated by independent local response functions but by a shared projection-fiber structure W(m)=∫_{F(m)}ρ_𝒦 dV_𝒦 (III.C) under global compatibility constraints.
• Does not require a local hidden-variable model on 𝓜: the fundamental correlational object is K (plus Π, Λ), not a spacetime-local λ that predetermines outcomes.

(2) Kochen–Specker (noncontextual value assignments).
Standard assumption package:
• Measurement noncontextuality: the value assigned to an observable is independent of which compatible measurement context it is embedded in.
• Functional consistency: value assignments respect functional relations among observables.
PCT stance:
• Rejects measurement noncontextuality: “measurement” is defined as stabilization/selection of a projection kernel Π(·|u;θ) within Λ-admissible θ (Postulate 6; V.T). Different contexts correspond to different stabilized projection families (different Π/θ sectors), so a single context-independent value map is not assumed.
• Operationally: only θ-invariant observables are context-stable (V.S). Context-sensitive statements are not globally composable across incompatible Π-stabilizations.

(3) PBR (ψ-ontology).
Standard assumption package:
• Preparation independence: independently prepared systems have product ontic states (λ_AB = (λ_A,λ_B) with independent distributions).
PCT stance:
• Rejects preparation independence generically: pregeometric states live on a correlated constraint manifold 𝒦 with kernel K(u,v) and population ρ_𝒦 that can encode global constraints across “subsystems.” Independence of emergent preparations is therefore an additional special-case assumption, not a default.
• Where it enters: subsystem factorization is treated as an admissibility/approximation condition on Π and ρ_𝒦 (and must be stated as a scope gate if invoked), rather than being built into the primitives.

(4) Frauchiger–Renner (single-world consistency under universal QM).
Standard assumption package (informal):
• Universal validity of quantum reasoning (agents can apply the formalism to other agents).
• Single-world consistency (unique outcomes that can be jointly combined into one global narrative without contradiction).
PCT stance:
• Uses an explicit “context-composition” restriction: outcomes are records stabilized under a particular admissible projection (V.T), and combining agents’ statements across mutually incompatible projection contexts is not guaranteed to be meaningful (a joint Π/Λ-admissible refinement may not exist).
• “Escape hatch”: when FR-style reasoning chains require simultaneous truth of statements drawn from incompatible projection stabilizations, PCT treats the inconsistency as a scope violation (no jointly admissible projection/record structure), not as a contradiction within one globally valid single-context description.

Summary (one sentence). PCT preserves operational no-signaling/microcausality (Π-factorization + Λ-4 + IV.B), but is explicitly contextual (Π/θ-dependent measurement definition) and does not assume preparation independence or globally composable single-world narratives across incompatible measurement/projection contexts.

V.V The Status of η = 1 
V.V.1 Current Status. η = 1 in S = ηA/(4ℓ_P²) is correspondence normalization, not derived. Analogous to setting G = 1. 
V.V.2 Derivation Roadmap. Route A: First-law consistency (dM = TdS + work) constrains η ≈ 1. Route B: Nosingular-endpoint condition forces η = 1 for entropy balance. 
Neither route is complete. We present η = 1 as calibration with plausible derivation path, not claimed result. 
V.W Update-Budget Coupling: A Novel Testable Relation 
The “update budget” interpretation can be promoted from interpretive gloss to a structural postulate linking Z_t and Z_s, yielding a genuinely novel prediction. 
V.W.1 The Two Observables. PCT commits to: (i) Clock-rate (time dilation): dτ/dt = 1/√(Z_t(ρ̄)), interpreting this as update-budget redistribution—fewer internal ticks per unit external time in high-ρ̄ regions. (ii) Characteristic propagation speed: v_char = c√(Z_s(ρ̄)/Z_t(ρ̄)), so the same environment field ρ̄ that slows clocks also reshapes causal cones. 
V.W.2 The Cross-Observable Constraint. Combining (i) and (ii): (eqV.W.1) v_char/c = √(Z_s(ρ̄)) × (dτ/dt). This is a nontrivial cross-observable relation: redshift/clock comparisons constrain Z_t; time-of-flight/Shapiro-delay measurements constrain Z_s/Z_t. Once Z_t is calibrated from redshift data, any independent commitment about Z_s produces a testable prediction for propagation delay. 
V.W.3 Budget Coupling Postulate. We elevate the update-budget interpretation to a structural postulate: (eqV.W.2) The same resource that enforces microcausal admissibility (hyperbolicity of Aμν) sets a joint constraint on Z_t and Z_s. Concretely, hyperbolicity requires Z_t, Z_s > 0 in the admissible regime. At the correspondence limit (ρ̄ → 0), both approach 1. At the critical limit (ρ̄ → ρ̄_crit), Z_s → 0 while Z_t → ∞ (horizon condition). These boundary conditions, combined with the metric-consistency requirement Z_t Z_s = 1, uniquely fix the relationship. 
V.W.4 Where PCT Can Differ from GR. In GR, Z_t and Z_s are locked by the Einstein equations: for Schwarzschild, Z_t = (1−r_s/r)⁻¹ and Z_s = (1−r_s/r), so Z_t Z_s = 1 exactly. PCT allows Z_t and Z_s to be independent functions until locked by correspondence. If the budget-coupling postulate (eqV.W.2) holds but with a different functional form than GR, PCT predicts: (eqV.W.3) Δ(v_char/c) / Δ(dτ/dt) ≠ (GR prediction) in strong-field regimes. 
V.W.5 Falsification Condition. If data prefer a Z_t consistent with redshift but a Z_s inconsistent with propagation delay in the same environment, then: (a) the budget-coupling postulate is wrong, or (b) additional degrees of freedom are required. This provides a sharp empirical handle: simultaneous measurement of gravitational redshift and Shapiro delay in strong-field systems (e.g., pulsar timing near black holes, gravitational wave propagation) can test whether Z_t and Z_s obey the PCT constraint or require independent specification.
V.W.6 Quantitative Prediction. Using the locked forms Z_t = 1/(1−f), Z_s = 1−f with f(ρ̄) monotonic:

(eqV.W.4) v_char/c = √(Z_s/Z_t) = 1 − f.

At r = 3r_s (f ≈ 1/3): v_char/c ≈ 0.667. At r = 2r_s (f ≈ 1/2): v_char/c ≈ 0.500. At r = 1.5r_s (f ≈ 2/3): v_char/c ≈ 0.333. These match the Schwarzschild-coordinate characteristic-speed prediction implied by the same metric-proxy convention used in Sections IV–V. Deviations appear at O((ℓ_P/r)²) from PCT’s discrete substructure, potentially detectable in precision pulsar timing or gravitational wave ringdown. own. 
V.X Why d_s = 2 is the Minimal Stable Phase 
PCT predicts a UV fixed point at d_s = 2, not d_s = 1. This is not an assumption but a structural necessity. We explain why d_s = 1 cannot serve as a stable pregeometric phase. 
V.X.1 No Redundancy in 1D. Record stability requires redundant correlations—multiple independent subsystems encoding the same information (V.T). In a 1D correlation structure, all correlations form a single chain with no nontrivial loops. There is no redundancy: information can pass through, but cannot be stored robustly. In PCT terms, 1D projections have measure-zero stability under Π; they collapse under arbitrarily small perturbations. Even if a 1D regime exists transiently, it cannot persist as a stable pregeometric phase. 
V.X.2 Entropy and Compatibility Collapse. The free-energy functional 𝓕 = U_corr − τ_int S_config (III.C) requires a balance between correlation energy and configurational entropy. In 1D: entropy growth is trivial (ordering dominates), compatibility constraints overconstrain the system, and projection volume collapses. The system either freezes (no dynamics) or rapidly bifurcates into higher-dimensional compatibility to relieve constraint pressure. 2D is the minimal dimension where entropy and compatibility can coexist dynamically. 
V.X.3 Causal Cone Emergence. Causal cones in 𝓜 emerge from anisotropic but multi-directional correlation propagation. In 1D there is no cone structure—only two directions (forward/backward along the chain). No angular structure exists, and no Lorentzian signature can emerge. The minimal requirement for causal cone emergence is: one effective timelike direction, at least one independent spacelike direction, and room for perturbations to define cone boundaries. This minimal requirement is d_s = 2, not d_s = 1. 
V.X.4 Convergence with Other Approaches. This result is not unique to PCT. Independent quantum gravity frameworks converge on d_s → 2 in the UV: causal dynamical triangulations, asymptotic safety, Hořava–Lifshitz gravity, noncommutative geometry, and spectral-dimension flows in random graphs. PCT provides a structural explanation: 2D is the lowest dimension supporting loops, redundancy, entropy growth, nontrivial projection angles, and causal cone structure. Anything below 2D is trivial, frozen, or non-persistent. 
V.X.5 Summary Statement. PCT does not assume a priori that the universe begins in two dimensions. Rather, it predicts that the lowest-dimensional correlational regime capable of sustaining stable, redundant projections is effectively two-dimensional. Any lower-dimensional regime would be dynamically unstable and non-projectable, leaving no observable imprint. The first physically meaningful emergent phase is d_s = 2, from which the system flows toward the unique Lorentzian IR attractor at d_s = 4. 
V.Y Propagation vs Metric Evolution: Why Expansion is Not Constrained by c 
In PCT, the speed of light c constrains signal propagation but not cosmic expansion. This distinction emerges structurally from the separation of two fundamentally different processes. 
V.Y.1 Propagation of Influence. Signal propagation is governed by the hop-per-tick bound in 𝒦: (eqV.Y.1) Δd_G / Δτ_int ≤ 1 where d_G is the graph distance and τ_int is internal time. This constraint projects to a causal speed limit c in 𝓜: no signal, force, field, or matter can propagate faster than c. This is the origin of microcausality in PCT. 
V.Y.2 Metric Renormalization. Cosmic expansion is achieved by changing how correlation-distance maps to metric distance—a global, relational update of the projection Π: 𝒦 → 𝓜. No signal is sent; the definition of distance itself changes. This process is not constrained by c because it is not propagation of correlations but rescaling of the correlator-to-distance map. 
V.Y.3 Superluminal Recession. Consequence: comoving separations can grow faster than c without violating microcausality. Superluminal recession velocities are allowed because: (i) no information is transmitted by expansion itself; (ii) causal cones remain intact; (iii) the hop bound constrains correlation updates, not coordinate separations. Horizons and causal disconnection arise when the reconstructed scale factor growth outpaces the ability of correlation updates to maintain mutual accessibility. 
V.Y.4 Acceleration Without New Fields. PCT allows accelerated expansion without introducing new fields (dark energy). A slight bias in correlation distribution across the entire network—if approximately homogeneous in 𝓜 and persistent under the 𝒦-dynamics—projects as a tiny curvature term spread throughout 𝓜, behaving like an effective cosmological constant Λ. The minimal conditions for this Λ-like behavior: (i) the bias is approximately constant across 𝓜; (ii) the 𝒦-dynamics does not relax it away quickly (it is a stable or slow mode); (iii) it changes a θ-invariant observable (e.g., curvature scalar), not just a rescaling. 

V.Y.5 Pregeometric thermodynamics and expansion (concise consistency module) 
This subsection records a minimal, notation-consistent bridge between (i) mixing/entropy on 𝒦, (ii) the two-time notion (internal update index τ_int vs emergent time t), and (iii) the expansion language used elsewhere in this manuscript (V.Y.2–V.Y.4). It is not a new dynamical completion; it is a bookkeeping module that makes explicit what is meant by “entropy increase” and how it can correlate with increased projection compatibility. 

(1) Entropy proxy on 𝒦 (concentration decreases under coarse-grained mixing). A convenient coarse-grained mixing diagnostic is the Rényi-2 entropy of the pregeometric population:
H_{2,𝒦}(τ_int) := −log( Σ_{u∈𝒦} ρ_𝒦(u,τ_int)^2 ).
An increase of H_{2,𝒦} corresponds to a decrease in L2 concentration, i.e., “constraints diminish” in the coarse-grained sense (cf. IV.C.4c).

(2) Evolution on 𝒦 (closed vs effectively open). The most general (Markovian) schematic split used in statistical physics is:
dϱ_𝒦/dτ_int = −i[H_𝒦, ϱ_𝒦] + 𝒟[ϱ_𝒦],
where 𝒟 may be zero for a closed global description and nonzero for reduced/coarse-grained subsystem descriptions. The arrow of time in emergent descriptions is then a statement about typical non-decrease of entropy after applying a coarse-graining/projection-compatible channel 𝓔 (cf. IV.C.4c).

(3) Expansion as growth of outward-compatible projection capacity (not signal propagation). A minimal scalar proxy for “increased projection compatibility” is the outward-compatible projection capacity integrated over a region Ω ⊂ 𝓜:
𝒞_out(τ_int) := ∫_Ω V_{Π,out}(x,τ_int) dμ_𝓜(x).
An expansion-signature regime (in the specific sense used in this paper) corresponds to d𝒞_out/dτ_int > 0. This is compatible with V.Y.2: it is a change in the correlator-to-distance mapping / projection-compatibility budget, not transmission of information through 𝓜, and therefore is not constrained by the emergent signal speed c.

Integration note (thermodynamics/time/expansion companion). The project file PCT/PCT_C_Thermodynamics_Time_Expansion_v2.txt is a longer companion note in the same notation family (𝒦, ρ_𝒦/ϱ_𝒦, τ_int, ρ̄, V_{Π,out}) that expands on the above three links without duplicating the present manuscript’s gravity and horizon modules.

Each falsifier includes: (i) observable; (ii) statistical threshold; (iii) data channel + date/experiment context; and (iv) what is being falsified (microclass axiom / locked choice / correspondence calibration).

Scope gate (interpretation preconditions). The falsifiers below assume the relevant regime diagnostics in “OPERATIONAL ‘APPLIES WHEN…’ CONDITIONS” are satisfied in the analysis region/window used for that test.
• If the hyperbolicity/admissibility conditions fail in the region where a ringdown/propagation template is being interpreted (m_t ≤ 0 or m_s ≤ 0), the model instance is excluded by construction (microcausality failure) rather than “falsified by data.”
• If manifold-likeness diagnostics fail in a region where a metric/geometry statement is being interpreted (quadratic residual/additivity tests fail), then GR/QFT-language comparisons are out of scope there; only pregeometric statements are meaningful (Regime III).on).

F1 (LVK ringdown change-point absent). 
• Observable: stacked preference for the PCT change-point ringdown model vs GR-only, using the template h(t)=h_GR(t)[1+ε(t)] with ε(t)=0 for t<t_c and ε(t)=ε_0 exp(−(t−t_c)/τ_d) for t≥t_c, with priors κ∈[0.75,0.85], ε_0∈[0.01,0.03]. 
• Threshold: Bayes factor B(change-point | GR) < 1/10 (stacked posterior; late-time-inclusive fit with start-time marginalization). 
• Channel/date: LVK ringdown analyses on post-merger data sets; for O4 data the run concluded 18 November 2025 (and subsequent public catalogs/updates thereafter). 
• Falsifies: microclass prediction module (κ-discontinuity → change-point imprint), i.e., microclass-level claim, not a calibration. 

F2 (κ outside allowed band). 
• Observable: posterior for κ from ringdown change-point inference (dimensionless, mass-independent). 
• Threshold: κ excludes [0.75, 0.85] at ≥90% credibility in stacked inference. 
• Channel/date: LVK ringdown analyses (same context as F1). 
• Falsifies: microclass-level claim (κ derived from microclass structure; not a tunable locked parameter in this manuscript’s status labeling). 

F3 (κ is not universal / shows mass or spin trend). 
• Observable: fitted trend of κ vs mass and spin after mapping to r_+(M,a*): κ(M,a*) inferred across events. 
• Threshold: any statistically significant trend inconsistent with “dimensionless invariant” behavior (e.g., |dκ/d ln M| > 0.05 at 2σ, or event-to-event scatter requiring κ to vary outside the quoted ±0.05 band). 
• Channel/date: LVK ringdown analyses (same context as F1). 
• Falsifies: microclass claim that κ is a θ-invariant, dimensionless output (invariance structure), not a calibration. 

F4 (multi-mode inconsistency of a single discontinuity). 
• Observable: κ inferred separately from multiple QNM modes (e.g., (2,2,0) vs (3,3,0)) in the same event under a shared change-point time scaling. 
• Threshold: |κ_220 − κ_330| > 0.05 (or >2σ) in events with multi-mode detection. 
• Channel/date: LVK multi-mode ringdown events (post-O4 and beyond). 
• Falsifies: microclass mechanism (single underlying d_s discontinuity), not a calibration. 

F5 (analogue spectral-dimension discontinuity absent). 
• Observable: measured d_s(ℓ) across the near-horizon/critical region in analogue implementations (BEC or optical lattice mapping), with resolution δℓ/ℓ* ≤ 0.1 and repeated runs. 
• Threshold: no statistically significant step in d_s(ℓ) (e.g., |Δd_s| < 0.3 at ≥3σ across any decade in ℓ within the mapped “near-horizon” region). 
• Channel/date: laboratory analogue-gravity experiments (post-publication; no fixed date). 
• Falsifies: microclass claim that Π-threshold crossing can generate a true discontinuity (as opposed to smooth flow). 

F6 (analogue discontinuity at wrong location). 
• Observable: κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H extracted from the analogue mapping (dimensionless). 
• Threshold: κ excludes 0.80 ± 0.10 at ≥3σ after mapping/uncertainty propagation. 
• Channel/date: laboratory analogue-gravity experiments (post-publication). 
• Falsifies: microclass quantitative prediction for κ (not a calibration), unless the analogue mapping assumptions are shown invalid (degeneracy controls below). 

F7 (CMB running wrong sign or too small). 
• Observable: running dn_s/d ln k from CMB parameter inference. 
• Threshold: dn_s/d ln k > 0 at ≥3σ (wrong sign) OR |dn_s/d ln k| < 0.005 at ≥3σ (rules out the predicted magnitude scale). 
• Channel/date: next-generation CMB datasets (e.g., CMB-S4 era; post-2026). 
• Falsifies: the locked cosmology-sector prediction module (PCT early-universe dimensional-flow imprint), i.e., a model-locked prediction rather than an IR calibration. 

F8 (tensor suppression fails). 
• Observable: tensor-to-scalar ratio r. 
• Threshold: r > 0.04 at ≥3σ. 
• Channel/date: next-generation CMB polarization missions (post-2026). 
• Falsifies: the locked cosmology-sector prediction module (tensor suppression tied to d_s≈2 UV phase); not a correspondence calibration. 

F9 (weak-field correspondence failure: PPN γ). 
• Observable: PPN parameter γ inferred from precision time-delay/deflection tests. 
• Threshold: γ differs from 1 by more than the accepted experimental uncertainty while the model-locked deformation predicts γ=1 at leading order. 
• Channel/date: precision weak-field tests (existing + future; not tied to a single date in this manuscript). 
• Falsifies: correspondence calibration layer for the chosen Z_t,Z_s mapping (i.e., the “constructed to reproduce GR in IR” target); this is a calibration/consistency failure, not new physics. 

F10 (cross-observable inconsistency of the shared deformation channel). 
• Observable: joint fit to redshift/clock-rate data (constraining Z_t) and propagation-delay/time-of-flight data (constraining Z_s/Z_t) in the same environment class, testing the cross-relation v_char/c = √(Z_s) × (dτ/dt). 
• Threshold: no single Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄) within the locked functional family can satisfy both data types at the same credibility level (e.g., joint-fit p-value < 0.01 or Bayes factor favoring “independent Z_t and Z_s” over “shared deformation” > 10). 
• Channel/date: strong-field timing/propagation settings (multi-messenger systems, pulsar timing, GW propagation; post-publication). 
• Falsifies: the locked choice that gravity is encoded solely via the shared principal-symbol deformation channel ρ̄→(Z_t,Z_s); i.e., locked-choice failure requiring additional degrees of freedom or a different Z-family.

Implementation pointers (non-exhaustive, for audit). The ringdown pipeline is implemented as a runnable code path (see PCT/gw_change_point_runner.py and PCT/gw_change_point_pilot.py), and the spectral-dimension step-detection protocol is implemented as a runnable module (PCT/pct_ds.py and PCT/analogue_ds_artifact.py). The CMB-inference scaffold is present (PCT/planck2018_running_inference.py); this table labels F7–F8 as TBD because the stated discriminating thresholds are explicitly tied to post-2026 (higher-sensitivity) datasets in the text above.

Degeneracy control (systematic). The checklist above is only meaningful if conventional confounders are separated from the PCT signatures in each channel. For ringdown (F1–F4), potential mimics include: waveform systematics (higher harmonics/overtone modeling errors), detector calibration drift, glitches, and environmental/astrophysical effects (accretion/medium-induced damping). Separation protocol: (i) explicitly marginalize over ringdown start time and include a “GR+systematics” nuisance model; (ii) require detector-consistency (H1/L1/V1) and off-source time-slide null tests; (iii) require mass/spin scaling consistency of t_c/r_+ (dimensionless invariance); and (iv) demand multi-mode agreement (F4). For analogue d_s(ℓ) tests (F5–F6), potential mimics include finite-size saturation, imaging resolution limits, non-diffusive transport regimes, and inhomogeneous noise; separation protocol: (i) demonstrate scaling stability under lattice-size increase and resolution refinement; (ii) verify that the step persists under alternative d_s estimators (return probability vs Green function); and (iii) perform “no-horizon” control runs where the engineered gradient is removed. For CMB (F7–F8), mimics include foreground modeling, beam systematics, parameter degeneracies with running/curvature/neutrino mass, and inflation-model priors; separation protocol: (i) require multi-frequency consistency and foreground-marginalized posteriors; (ii) test robustness under extended parameter sets (e.g., varying N_eff, Σm_ν); and (iii) check the correlated pattern (enhanced |dn_s/d ln k| with suppressed r) rather than either parameter in isolation. For weak-field and cross-observable tests (F9–F10), mimics include ephemeris/systematic timing biases and model-dependent environment mapping ρ̄↔potential; separation protocol: (i) use multiple independent measurement types (redshift + Shapiro delay + deflection) and require internal consistency within the same environment class, and (ii) treat any needed environment mapping as an explicit calibration step with uncertainty propagation (so a failure is attributable to calibration vs microclass prediction). 

Null controls and “non-spurious” acceptance criteria (per empirical channel).
These are concrete, executable controls that (i) should return null when the discriminator mechanism is absent, and (ii) must be passed before any nonzero discriminator statistic is treated as non-spurious. They are designed to preserve PCT consistency: they do not treat θ as a physical knob, and they only compare θ-invariant outputs/statistics across controls.

Channel 1: GW ringdown change-point (F1–F4).
Null controls (minimum two; recommended three).
(GW-NC1) Off-source time slides. Re-run the full inference pipeline on time-shifted multi-detector data (shifts ≫ light travel time) using the same [t_0,t_1] windowing and PSD estimation; record the null distribution of ln B.
(GW-NC2) GR-only injections. Inject GR-only ringdowns into either real off-source data or simulated Gaussian noise (same PSD, same windowing), then run the same model comparison; record the null ln B distribution and set ln B_thr at a stated percentile (Appendix C.6.1).
(GW-NC3) Waveform/systematics swap. Repeat the inference with at least one alternate GR baseline/systematics choice (e.g., different overtone/higher-mode treatment or a different ringdown approximant), keeping the PCT change-point family fixed; check that ln B and κ do not depend materially on this choice.

Acceptance criteria (call the discriminator non-spurious only if all are satisfied).
(GW-AC1) False-positive calibration: with ln B_thr set from GW-NC2 at a stated target FPR (default: 1%), the observed on-source ln B exceeds ln B_thr and the measured off-source/time-slide exceedance rate is consistent with the target FPR (within stated binomial uncertainty).
(GW-AC2) Consistency across detectors: per-event κ posteriors from individual detectors overlap within 2σ (or a stated criterion), and the combined multi-detector inference is not dominated by a single detector.
(GW-AC3) Universality checks pass: κ is consistent with a dimensionless invariant under the mass/spin scaling tests in V.G.15.3 (R1–R3) and does not show a statistically significant trend (F3–F4 thresholds).

Channel 2: Spectral-dimension discontinuity d_s(ℓ) (F5–F6; analogue or in-silico).
Null controls (minimum two; recommended three).
(DS-NC1) Estimator swap. Compute d_s(ℓ) via two independent estimators (e.g., heat-trace/return-probability estimator vs a Green-function or alternative trace estimator; and, numerically, eigendecomposition vs Hutchinson trace where applicable).
(DS-NC2) No-horizon control. Run the same pipeline on a matched control configuration where the engineered horizon/gradient is removed (so the near-horizon suppression diagnostics fail by design), keeping size, discretization, and estimator settings the same.
(DS-NC3) Data split / resampling. Compute d_s(ℓ) on disjoint subsets of the graph/measurement runs (e.g., random node subsamples or run-to-run splits) and verify the step statistic is stable under the split.

Acceptance criteria.
(DS-AC1) Step/non-step discrimination: a step/non-step statistic exceeds the stated significance threshold (default: ≥3σ, as in F5) in the horizon case.
(DS-AC2) Null suppression: in the no-horizon control, the inferred step magnitude is consistent with zero within uncertainty (Δd_s ≈ 0) and the step/non-step statistic is not significant.
(DS-AC3) Robustness: the inferred (κ, Δd_s) are stable under DS-NC1 (estimator swap) and DS-NC3 (splits/resampling) to within a stated tolerance (recommended: |Δκ| ≤ 0.05 and |Δ(Δd_s)| ≤ 0.3 at fixed refinement level), and remain stable under at least one refinement/size increase.

Channel 3: CMB running dn_s/d ln k (F7–F8).
Null controls (minimum two; recommended three).
(CMB-NC1) Likelihood-component ablation. Repeat the inference under at least two likelihood-component combinations, e.g., TT-only vs TT+TE+EE, and with/without the lensing likelihood, holding the parameterization and priors fixed.
(CMB-NC2) Foreground/systematics prior swap. Repeat with an alternative foreground model/prior set (within the accepted likelihood framework), and report the resulting shifts in the running posterior.
(CMB-NC3) Alternative parameter extensions. Repeat with one-at-a-time extensions (\Omega_k, \Sigma m_\nu, N_\mathrm{eff}) as already recommended in V.M.4, to test whether the running signal is a proxy for an extended-parameter degeneracy.

Acceptance criteria.
(CMB-AC1) Posterior stability: the posterior for dn_s/d ln k is stable in sign and magnitude across CMB-NC1–CMB-NC3; specifically, the posterior mean/median shifts by less than the reported 1σ uncertainty under each control, and the sign does not flip.
(CMB-AC2) Non-spurious preference: the inferred running does not arise solely from a single likelihood component (e.g., present in TT-only but absent in TE/EE-only) and remains consistent under foreground-model variation.
(CMB-AC3) Pattern-level check: the correlated signature (enhanced negative running with suppressed r) remains consistent across controls; if running appears without the associated r suppression (or vice versa) under robust analyses, treat the apparent signal as likely spurious with respect to the locked PCT cosmology module.

APPENDIX E: PROOF-SKETCH COLLECTION (FREQUENTLY INVOKED CLAIMS)

Purpose (reader-facing). This appendix collects proof sketches for claims invoked more than once in the manuscript. Each sketch is intentionally short and includes: (i) assumptions, (ii) main steps, and (iii) what would require additional work for a full proof.

E.0 How to read these sketches
• These are not new axioms. They are reminders of which hypotheses are doing the work.
• When a claim is “model-locked,” the proof is conditional on the locked choices in Section V.A.
• When a claim is “microclass-level,” the proof is conditional on M1–M5 (Section III.E).

E.1 Theorem 4 (Continuum limit: discrete → continuous)
Claim (informal). Under stated convergence hypotheses for the discrete embeddings, kernels, and measures, the induced correlators converge and the generators converge in a semigroup/resolvent sense.
(i) Assumptions.
• Embeddings φ_N: 𝒦_N → 𝒦_∞ converge in Hausdorff distance.
• Uniform kernel convergence: sup_{u,v} |K_N(φ_N^{-1}(u),φ_N^{-1}(v)) − K_∞(u,v)| → 0.
• Weak convergence of measures: μ_N∘φ_N^{-1} ⇀ μ_∞.
• Integrability / boundedness conditions sufficient to exchange limits and sums/integrals in the definition of G₂.
(ii) Main steps.
1) View the discrete double sum defining G₂^{(N)} as a Riemann-sum approximation to the continuum double integral defining G₂^{(∞)}.
2) Use the kernel and measure convergence assumptions to pass to the limit uniformly on compact subsets of 𝓜×𝓜.
3) Define L_ρ^{(N)} and L_ρ^{(∞)} as inverse-kernel operators (or, equivalently, as generators of the corresponding heat semigroups).
4) Apply a semigroup convergence theorem (e.g., Trotter–Kato) to promote convergence of kernels to strong resolvent convergence of generators.
(iii) Additional work for a full proof.
• Explicit functional-analytic setup: specify the Hilbert spaces on which L_ρ^{(N)} act, and the identification maps between discrete and continuum spaces.
• Uniform bounds (e.g., sectoriality, dissipativity) ensuring the required compactness and semigroup tightness.
• A precise statement about how ν_Θ and Π scale with N in the limit (especially when Π is not deterministic).

E.2 Theorem 5 (Metric reconstruction + Hawking-scaling proxy)
Claim (informal). If G₂ is sufficiently regular near the diagonal, then correlator decay defines a local metric tensor; and once a horizon boundary is defined operationally, a boundary steepness functional yields a Hawking-scaling proxy.
(i) Assumptions.
• G₂(x,x)>0 and normalized correlator Ĝ₂ is well-defined.
• Regularity: G₂ is C² near the diagonal in the regime where metric extraction is asserted.
• (For the PSD/positivity step) kernel positivity/PSD conditions sufficient to treat −∂_μ∂_ν ln G₂|_{y=x} as positive semidefinite.
• For the Hawking-scaling proxy: a horizon boundary ∂B is defined (e.g., via V_{Π,out} collapse) and ρ̄ has a well-defined outward normal derivative at ∂B.
(ii) Main steps.
1) Define d_corr via the normalized correlator and expand ln G₂(x,x+δy) to second order in δy.
2) Identify the quadratic form in δy with a symmetric tensor g^{(E)}_{μν}.
3) Use kernel positivity (and/or RKHS feature-map representation) to justify positive semidefiniteness of the resulting tensor in the asserted regime.
4) For the Hawking-scaling proxy: define the boundary steepness functional G(x)=|∂ρ̄/∂n|/ρ̄_crit and define κ_PCT := c·Ḡ; then T_H ∝ κ_PCT is a definition-level scaling proxy once the boundary data are fixed.
(iii) Additional work for a full proof.
• Explicit conditions under which the differentiations and normalizations commute with the (u,v,θ)-integrations defining G₂.
• A fully rigorous positivity argument for g^{(E)}_{μν} in the continuum setting (including domains where G₂ has sign structure, complex phases, or is not strictly positive).
• A careful statement of when g^{(E)}_{μν} (correlator-distance metric) can be related to the Lorentzian cone proxy g^{(L)}_{μν}; this requires explicit BC gates in each use.

E.3 Theorem 6 (Deformation form under metric-consistency constraints)
Claim (informal). Under hyperbolicity, asymptotic-flatness, and a metric-consistency condition g_tt g_rr = −1 in the proxy convention, the deformation can be parameterized by a single monotone f with Z_s=1−f and Z_t=1/(1−f).
(i) Assumptions.
• Hyperbolicity on the admissible exterior: Z_t>0 and Z_s>0.
• Asymptotic flatness: Z_t,Z_s → 1 as ρ̄ → 0.
• Proxy convention: g_tt = −1/Z_t and g_rr = 1/Z_s, with g_tt g_rr = −1.
• Horizon condition: Z_s/Z_t → 0 as ρ̄ → ρ̄_crit.
(ii) Main steps.
1) From g_tt g_rr = −1 infer Z_t Z_s = 1.
2) Parameterize Z_s(ρ̄)=1−f(ρ̄); then Z_t(ρ̄)=1/(1−f(ρ̄)).
3) Use asymptotic flatness and the horizon condition to fix boundary values f(0)=0 and f(ρ̄_crit)=1.
(iii) Additional work for a full proof.
• Clarify the status of the metric-consistency condition: in v52 it is a convention/locking choice for the proxy metric and should not be conflated with a derived dynamical constraint.
• For non-static or non-spherically symmetric settings, specify what replaces g_tt g_rr = −1 and how Z_t,Z_s generalize beyond the isotropic ansatz.

E.4 Theorem 9 (Continuity of d_s(ℓ) under GR+EFT assumptions)
Claim (informal). Under standard locality/smoothness assumptions on the background and action, the spectral dimension defined from the heat trace is continuous in diffusion scale.
(i) Assumptions.
• Local differential operator of Laplace type on a smooth (at least C²) background.
• Standard heat-kernel asymptotics and existence of the Seeley–DeWitt expansion.
• No threshold/nonlocal effects that would introduce step functions in the spectrum as a function of scale.
(ii) Main steps.
1) Use that the heat kernel K(x,x;σ) admits an asymptotic expansion in σ with smooth coefficient functions.
2) Integrate over x to obtain Tr(e^{−σΔ}) as a smooth function of σ for σ>0.
3) Differentiate ln Tr(e^{−σΔ}) with respect to ln σ to obtain d_s(σ) as a continuous function (for σ>0).
(iii) Additional work for a full proof.
• Spell out the operator class precisely (elliptic vs hyperbolic, Wick rotation assumptions, domain and boundary conditions).
• Make explicit how adding extra light degrees of freedom or explicit nonlocality can evade the continuity conclusion.

E.5 Proposition 1 (Kernel-selection “uniqueness” sketch)
Claim (informal). Under symmetry, entropy-maximization, and a complexity-minimization criterion, the selected kernel falls into an exponential/RBF family with a determined scale parameter.
(i) Assumptions.
• G-invariance restricts the kernel to depend on an orbit/graph distance.
• A well-defined entropy functional S[K̂] and a complexity functional C[K].
• A constraint set sufficient to make the optimization problem well-posed.
(ii) Main steps.
1) Reduce to radial kernels via symmetry (kernel depends only on d_𝔾(u,v)).
2) Solve the maximum-entropy problem under the stated constraint(s), yielding an exponential family over the distance.
3) Fix the remaining scale parameter by minimizing the complexity functional within that family.
(iii) Additional work for a full proof.
• Specify the admissible set of kernels (topology/compactness) and prove existence/uniqueness of the optimizer.
• Justify the chosen entropy/complexity functionals as the correct ones for the intended physical meaning.
• Provide a stability theorem: small perturbations of the criteria should not lead to discontinuous changes in the selected kernel.

 
CASE STUDY: Gravitational Screening via Correlation Projection 
This case study examines whether PCT permits configurations that reduce, screen, or effectively reverse gravitational influence—what is colloquially termed “antigravity.” We work purely at the theoretical level, identifying which variables would need to change and what predictions follow, without providing engineering guidance. 
CS.1 What “Gravity Control” Means in PCT 
In PCT, gravity is not a force and curvature is not primitive. Gravity-like behavior in 𝓜 is the projection shadow of how compatibility constraints restrict correlations: ρ_𝒦(u) → ρ̄(x;θ) → A^{μν}(x) → causal cones + clock rates. Therefore, “control over gravity-like behavior” means control over how strongly correlations are restricted, anisotropically, in projection. Nothing else. CS.2 The Five Control Variables 
PCT has exactly five places where effective gravity can change: (1) Constraint population on pregeometry ρ_𝒦(u): The primary source. Higher ρ_𝒦 → higher projected ρ̄; gradients in ρ_𝒦 → curvature-like effects. This is “massenergy” in PCT language. Any gravity modulation must ultimately correspond to a redistribution of ρ_𝒦. (2) Projection kernel Π(x|u;θ): Controls how pregeometric constraints map into 𝓜. Key features: width/spread (σ_Π), anisotropy of support, tail behavior. Narrower/more anisotropic kernels → stronger effective gravity for the same ρ_𝒦; broader kernels → weaker gravity. This is the only place where gravity strength can be altered without changing total constraint content. (3) Projected environment scalar ρ̄(x;θ): Constructed from (1) and (2) via ρ̄ = [∑_u ρ_𝒦(u)² Π(x|u;θ)] / [∑_u ρ_𝒦(u) Π(x|u;θ)]. All gravity-like effects are functions of ρ̄. (4) Deformation maps Z_t(ρ̄), Z_s(ρ̄): Map environment to causal structure. Trapping and strong gravity require anisotropy: Z_t ≠ Z_s. Pure isotropic rescaling does not produce gravity. (5) Gradients, not absolute values: Uniform shifts in ρ̄ mostly renormalize clocks. Only gradients ∇ρ̄ ≠ 0 produce observable gravitational structure. 
CS.3 What Does NOT Work 
(i) Changing projection angle θ alone: Since θ is gauge (V.S), observable physics must be θ-invariant, so changing θ alone cannot produce physical gravity control. (ii) Local “metric manipulation”: There is no metric to manipulate at the fundamental level; geometry is derived, not controlled. (iii) Negative mass: Mass in PCT is not a signed scalar but a measure of constraint population and its gradients. Making it “negative” would require reversing causal admissibility or record stability, which breaks the framework. 
CS.4 Gravitational Screening Without Negative Mass 
Effective repulsion can arise from correlation anisotropy or redistribution without negative mass. The mechanism: preserve internal constraint population and redundancy (no record erasure), but modify how correlations couple to the environment (projection profile/anisotropy) so that external gradients are reduced or reshaped. This yields gravitational screening or effective repulsion while internal physics remains stable. In PCT terms: repulsive gravity ≠ negative mass. 
CS.5 Dimensionless Gravity Control Parameter 
We define a dimensionless parameter tracking “how gravitational” a region is: (eqCS.1) Local anisotropy index: A(x) := ln(Z_t(ρ̄(x))) − ln(Z_s(ρ̄(x))). A = 0 means no anisotropic deformation (weak/no trapping); larger A means stronger effective gravity. (eqCS.2) Dimensionless inhomogeneity index: 𝒢(x) := L · |∇A(x)| where L is the characteristic coarse-graining scale. If 𝒢 ≈ 0 everywhere, you get uniform rescaling (not force-like gravity); if 𝒢 is large, you get curvature/acceleration-like effects. (eqCS.3) The gravity control parameter: 𝒫(x) := L · |∇ln(Z_t/Z_s)|. This is the clean control parameter: it vanishes for uniform shifts and grows when cone/clock deformation varies across space. Gravitational screening corresponds to configurations where 𝒫 → 0 despite nonzero ρ̄. 
CS.6 Why Retrocausality is Forbidden 
Even extreme manipulation of ρ_𝒦, Π, Z_t, Z_s cannot produce controllable influence into the past of 𝓜. PCT enforces three structural constraints: (i) Projection factorization for spacelike separation (V.U): Marginals cannot depend on distant settings. (ii) Hyperbolic admissibility: Retarded structure only; no advanced Green support. (iii) Record stability (V.T): Redundant records cannot be overwritten without global inconsistency. True retrocausality would require violating one of these, which destroys the mechanisms that make spacetime, observers, and probabilities exist. At best, gravity manipulation yields correlations, post-selected consistency, and delayed-choicetype effects—but never signaling. 
CS.7 Connection to Dark Energy 
The uniform correlation bias discussed in V.Y.4 (which produces Λ-like acceleration) is a global instance of gravitational screening. Locally anisotropic versions of the same mechanism—where ρ̄ gradients are flattened or inverted—would produce localized gravitational screening or effective repulsion. This connects “antigravity” to dark energy: both arise from correlation redistribution that reduces or reverses the sign of ∇ρ̄. 
CS.8 Testability in Analogue Systems 
The gravitational screening mechanism can be tested in analogue systems without building devices: (i) Simulation protocol: Choose a graph/constraint ensemble, define ρ_𝒦, choose Π, compute ρ̄(x), then reconstruct correlator distances and infer effective metric/curvature. Look for regimes where curvature decreases or changes sign under controlled parameter sweeps. (ii) BEC/optical lattice implementation: Tune correlation structure anisotropically; measure spectral dimension or propagation properties; test whether 𝒫(x) can be driven toward zero while maintaining nonzero ρ̄. (iii) Falsification: If no Π-profile exists within the microclass 𝒨 that produces 𝒫 → 0 with ρ̄ > 0, then gravitational screening is forbidden by PCT, not merely difficult. 
CS.9 Formal Protocol: Outputs and Sharp Falsification 
Given inputs (ρ_𝒦, Π, Z_t, Z_s, L), the protocol outputs: (eqCS.9a) 𝒫(x) = L·|∇ln(Z_t/Z_s)|: the spatial gravitystrength profile. (eqCS.9b) Predicted gravitational redshift between points x_1, x_2: ν_2/ν_1 = (dτ/dt)(x_2) / (dτ/dt)(x_1) = √(Z_t(ρ̄(x_1))/Z_t(ρ̄(x_2))). (eqCS.9c) Predicted propagation-delay profile from v_char(x) = c√(Z_s/Z_t): slower propagation where Z_t dominates. 
Sharp Falsification Criteria. Consolidated in the Master Falsification Checklist (V.Z; see F9–F10 and associated degeneracy controls). 
Internal vs External Modification. The theoretical requirement for screening without disrupting the screened system: (i) Internal stability: preserve redundancy/records, keep subsystem’s correlation structure mutually compatible. (ii) External influence modification: alter the coupling of subsystem correlations to the environment in Π—how much the environment “samples” the subsystem’s constraint population—while leaving internal ρ_𝒦 relations unchanged. The result: internal correlators remain robust; subsystem–environment projection weighting is modified so that ∇ρ̄ and ∇ln(Z_t/Z_s) around the subsystem are reduced or reshaped. Formally, decompose the correlation matrix into blocks: K = [K_II, K_IE; K_EI, K_EE] where I = internal nodes, E = external/environment nodes. Screening is implemented by modifying only the Π-weighting of cross-block terms K_IE, K_EI (or equivalently, the projection kernel’s coupling between subsystem and environment), while K_II remains invariant. This ensures the subsystem’s internal physics is unchanged while its gravitational influence on (and from) the environment is reduced. 
Case Study Summary 
In PCT, gravity can be attenuated or effectively reversed through correlation-induced screening without invoking negative mass. The effect arises from modifying projection-level anisotropy (the kernel Π and resulting ρ̄ gradients) while preserving internal correlation stability. The control parameter 𝒫(x) = L·|∇ln(Z_t/Z_s)| quantifies gravitational strength; screening corresponds to 𝒫 → 0. No admissible manipulation allows retrocausal signaling. Dark energy and local gravitational screening are two manifestations of the same underlying mechanism: 
correlation redistribution that modifies ∇ρ̄. 
VALIDITY AND EVIDENCE (RUBRIC; v51 — expanded)

This section is a self-audit of what the manuscript *does* and *does not* currently provide, using an explicit rubric. Scores are not claims of confirmation; they measure progress along the chain:
(i) internal specification → (ii) falsifiable discriminator → (iii) executed empirical confrontation.

Pending items tracker (v52; single list).
This tracker enumerates every remaining “TBD / compute pending” empirical-result item referenced in the manuscript and pins each to (i) the *exact* table/figure where the final number must appear and (ii) a minimal criterion for calling it resolved.

(1) GW pilot data provenance ledger (inputs; must be reproducible).
• Final values must appear in: Appendix C, Table C.1a.
• Pending: all fields currently marked “TBD” (LVK open-data release identifier; GPS segment start/stop; sampling rate; PSD segment definition; PSD method details; bandpass; notch list) for each event×detector.
• Minimal “resolved” criterion: every “TBD” cell in C.1a is replaced by a concrete identifier/value, and the combination (event, detector, release ID, GPS start/stop) uniquely determines the exact strain/quality product used.

(2) GW pilot event-level results (real-data confrontation).
• Final values must appear in: Appendix C, Table C.5a (event rows + “Combined/stacked” row).
• Pending: Δln Z, ln B, κ posterior summaries (median + 90% CI), and the exact ringdown windowing choices [t_0,t_1] and t_0 prior bounds.
• Minimal “resolved” criterion: (i) all “TBD” entries in C.5a are replaced by numerical values, (ii) each event’s κ posterior is reported (median + 90% CI), and (iii) the stacked result is reported with a stated stacking rule.

(3) GW null controls (false-positive calibration and glitch controls).
• Final values must appear in: Appendix C, Tables C.6.1 and C.6.2.
• Pending: N trials, ln B threshold, false-positive rate, and ln B summary statistics under (a) GR-only injections and (b) off-source time slides.
• Minimal “resolved” criterion: both null-control tables are filled with concrete numbers and an explicit ln B threshold, and the reported false-positive rate is finite and interpretable.

(4) Ringdown reproducibility artifact pointer.
• Final value must appear in: V.G.15.4 (“Code Availability…” sentence).
• Pending: the “TBD” repository/availability statement.
• Minimal “resolved” criterion: the “TBD” marker is replaced by a stable, unambiguous pointer to the exact artifact bundle (code + config + seeds) that reproduces Appendix C outputs.

(5) CMB running posterior reproduction (execute the inference, not just quote Planck).
• Final values must appear in: V.M.4 (Running), as an explicit posterior summary line immediately following the sentence that quotes the Planck 2018 constraint.
• Pending: an executed parameter-inference run (stated likelihood configuration, sampler, convergence criteria, parameter set/priors) producing a posterior for dn_s/d ln k.
• Minimal “resolved” criterion: the manuscript reports an explicit posterior summary (mean/median + interval(s)) for dn_s/d ln k from a stated likelihood configuration, and states whether the PCT prediction (−0.012 ± 0.005) lies inside the 68% and/or 95% interval.

(6) Analogue-gravity discontinuity measurement (future empirical test).
• Final values must appear in: V.K (Analogue-Gravity Experimental Proposal), as a single d_s(ℓ) plot with a marked ℓ* and a caption reporting κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H.
• Pending: an executed analogue/lab dataset (or in-lab analysis) showing (or refuting) a statistically significant step and a measured κ.
• Minimal “resolved” criterion: the figure reports (i) a step/non-step statistic with uncertainty and (ii) κ with uncertainty, and the analysis documents the “no-horizon” control run required by V.Z (F5–F6).

C.2.4 empirical-success status (resolved; what exists *in this manuscript*).
Discriminators and evidence status:
(a) Completed in-manuscript analyses with reported numbers.
• In-silico / toy spectral-dimension discontinuity (κ, Δd_s): numbers and convergence/robustness summaries are reported in V.B.2, V.G.3, V.G.7, and V.J.2–V.J.4.

(b) Fully specified protocol with compute pending (results explicitly tracked as TBD).
• GW ringdown change-point inference on real events (GW150914, GW170814): analysis protocol and priors are specified in V.G.15, with an execution-ready reproducibility capsule in Appendix C (including the compact results table C.5a, currently TBD) and an operator’s guide in Appendix D.1.

(c) Proposed future tests (no executed analysis or fully instantiated, runnable capsule in-manuscript yet).
• Analogue-gravity measurement of a d_s(ℓ) step and κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H: proposal/mapping in V.K; falsifiers and required controls in V.Z (F5–F6).
• Next-generation CMB inference for dn_s/d ln k (and correlated pattern with r): prediction and current constraint comparison in V.M.4–V.M.5; falsifiers and robustness requirements in V.Z (F7–F8).

Bottom line. In v52, the manuscript contains one executed numerical discriminator demonstration with concrete numbers (the in-silico κ/Δd_s module), while all real-data confrontations (GW ringdown and CMB/analogue channels) are specified as protocols/proposals with their required outputs explicitly marked as pending (TBD).

B.9 Empirical support (executed confrontation; one channel; falsifier outcomes F1–F6).
Purpose. To avoid “protocol-only” evidence claims, this subsection records one completed confrontation with full falsifier reporting (including null controls) in a single channel. In v52, the only channel with executed numbers is the in-silico spectral-dimension (DS) channel (V.B/V.G/V.J). Therefore, the DS channel is used here as the completed confrontation, while GW falsifiers are explicitly marked as not-yet-executed (no empirical claim made).

Completed confrontation (DS channel; executed; Runnable now).
• Channel: in-silico / toy near-horizon spectral-dimension step test.
• Data type: synthetic kernel/graph instance defined by the locked toy setup (V.A, V.B), analyzed end-to-end by the fixed d_s(ℓ) and step-extraction protocol (IV.A.5a; V.G.5) using the reference implementation PCT/pct_ds.py.
• Headline outputs (reported elsewhere; repeated here for the evidence ledger):
  – Step magnitude: Δd_s ≈ 0.79 ± 0.02 (finite-N; V.G.3; with convergence/robustness in V.J.2–V.J.4).
  – Step location ratio: κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H = 0.80 ± 0.05 (V.G.7).
• Negative controls (executed): the far-exterior / “no-horizon” region shows no discontinuity by the same fixed protocol (V.G.1; r > 3rᴵ vs r ≈ rᴵ comparison).

Preregistered decision rule (applied as written; no post-hoc retuning).
• Step present iff (i) the step-vs-smooth comparison favors the step model by the pre-declared threshold (e.g., ΔAIC_step ≥ 10, or the Bayes-factor threshold stated in IV.A.5a) and (ii) the same decision rule rejects the null at the declared α via the manuscript’s baseline protocol (V.Z / DS-NC*), with θ-stability and refinement/estimator-swap checks passing (V.J.2–V.J.4).
• Step absent otherwise.

Master falsifier outcomes (F1–F6) as of v52.
Reporting convention.
• PASS/FAIL refers to whether the falsifier condition is triggered.
• “NOT RUN (no claim)” means this manuscript makes no empirical claim in that channel and does not count the item as supporting evidence.

| Falsifier ID | Channel | What would falsify (very short) | Status in this manuscript (v52) | Evidence basis (where) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | GW ringdown | Real-data Bayes factor decisively favors GR-only over change-point beyond null-calibrated threshold | NOT RUN (TBD / no claim) | Appendix C/C.5a is TBD |
| F2 | GW ringdown | κ posterior excludes κ∈[0.75,0.85] in real events | NOT RUN (TBD / no claim) | Appendix C/C.5a is TBD |
| F3 | GW ringdown | κ shows significant mass/spin trend (violates dimensionless-invariant universality) | NOT RUN (TBD / no claim) | Appendix C/C.5a is TBD |
| F4 | GW ringdown | Detector inconsistency: κ posteriors disagree across detectors beyond uncertainty | NOT RUN (TBD / no claim) | Appendix C/C.5a is TBD |
| F5 | DS step | No statistically significant near-horizon step once estimator-swap/refinement controls are met (or step appears in the no-horizon control) | DONE NOW (not falsified): step detected near horizon; negative control is smooth | V.G.1–V.G.4; V.G.3; V.J.2–V.J.4 |
| F6 | DS step | κ inferred from ℓ*/r_H lies outside [0.75,0.85] under the declared mapping | DONE NOW (not falsified): κ = 0.80 ± 0.05 | V.G.5; V.G.7 |

Status note (scope honesty).
This B.9 entry increases empirical-support transparency by (i) pinning a completed confrontation to concrete numbers already on the page, and (ii) explicitly listing which falsifiers remain unexecuted (so they do not contribute to empirical support). The first *observational* confrontation that can upgrade B.9 beyond “in-silico” will be the GW ringdown pilot once Appendix C tables are filled.

A. One-page summary of falsifiable predictions (and what would count as a failure)

Important separation (method). PCT-as-written contains:
• Correspondence targets (must match; not confirmatory): weak-field redshift/time dilation, cone structure, IR locality/QFT-like regime.
• Discriminators (could fail; potentially confirmatory): predictions that differ qualitatively from GR/QFT baselines and come with explicit null tests.

A.1 Primary discriminator module: near-horizon dimensional discontinuity
• Observable pair (headline): (κ, Δd_s), where κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H and Δd_s is the step size in d_s(ℓ) across ℓ* (V.G).
• Locked headline numbers (in this manuscript’s canonical instantiation): κ = 0.80 ± 0.05 and Δd_s ≈ 0.79 ± 0.15 (V.G.7), with continuum-extrapolation guidance in V.J.
• Why it is discriminating: local GR+EFT completions yield continuous spectral-dimension flow under standard assumptions; PCT predicts a non-analytic step at finite ℓ* (V.G.2–V.G.4).
• What would falsify it (examples; consolidated in V.Z): (i) no statistically significant step in d_s(ℓ) in the near-horizon regime when resolution and estimator controls are met (F5), or (ii) κ inferred from the step location excludes [0.75,0.85] in a controlled mapping (F6).

A.2 Ringdown imprint of the discontinuity (GW channel)
• Observable structure (not “a generic mode shift”): a late-time change-point in the ringdown residual, using ε(t)=0 for t<t_c and ε(t)=ε_0 exp(−(t−t_c)/τ_d) for t≥t_c (V.G.15).
• Scaling prediction: t_c(M,a*) ∝ κ r_+(M,a*)/c; κ is dimensionless and therefore predicted to be mass-independent (V.G.15; V.Z F3).
• Amplitude scale: ε_0 ≈ 0.02 ± 0.01 (order-of-magnitude; template parameter) (V.G.15).
• What would falsify it: stacked late-time analyses prefer GR-only over the change-point model at strong odds, or inferred κ lies outside the allowed band, or κ shows a statistically significant mass/spin trend inconsistent with a dimensionless invariant (V.Z F1–F4).

A.3 Early-universe dimensional-flow imprint (CMB channel; model-locked)
• Observable: running of the scalar spectral index, dn_s/d ln k = −0.012 ± 0.005 (V.M.4).
• Correlated pattern (stronger than a single number): enhanced negative running with suppressed r, conditional on the cosmology mapping choices in V.I–V.M.
• What would falsify it: decisive sign/magnitude exclusion (e.g., running consistent with 0 at the few×10⁻3 level, or positive at high significance), and/or an r value inconsistent with the predicted suppression pattern (V.Z F7–F8).

A.4 Strong-field “shared deformation channel” cross-check (consistency discriminator)
• Observable: a joint consistency test linking redshift/clock-rate (Z_t) and propagation delay (Z_s/Z_t) via v_char/c = √(Z_s) × (dτ/dt) (V.W; V.Z F10).
• What would falsify it: data require Z_t and Z_s to be effectively independent (no shared deformation channel) within a given environment class (F10).

A.5 Secondary/conditional predictions (lower priority)
• Environment-dependent horizon-scaling proxy (V.C): ΔT_H/T_H proportional to ΔE_ext to leading order (V.C.2). This is operationally sharp in-model but hard to isolate astrophysically; best treated as a numerical/analogue target until a clean observational mapping exists.
• White-hole/constraint-release events (V.E): explicitly labeled speculative/conditional; not counted as a primary discriminator.

B. Practical improvements to increase “validity and evidence” (what to add/change in the next revision)

B.1 Tighten the prediction/evidence ledger (reduce ambiguity)
• Add a single “Predictions Table” with three columns: (i) prediction, (ii) what is calibrated/assumed for that prediction, (iii) what data analysis would output (measured statistic + threshold) (cross-referencing V.Z).
• For each prediction, add a one-line “scope gate” reminder: which regime diagnostics must pass before the prediction is even applicable (hyperbolicity, manifold-likeness, near-horizon suppression).

Minimal Predictions Table (template; to be instantiated).

| Prediction (discriminator) | Calibrated / assumed inputs (not counted as confirmation) | Output statistic + threshold (cross-ref V.Z) | Scope gate (“applies when…”) |
|---|---|---|---|
| (κ, Δd_s) near-horizon spectral-dimension discontinuity | Locked Π-family + kernel family/selection + d_s estimator; horizon-scale definition r_H (V.G.5); continuum scaling assumptions (V.J.1) | Step/non-step test and κ exclusion test (F5–F6) | Near-horizon regime diagnostic passes: V_Π,out small and v_char suppressed; manifold-likeness sufficient for interpreting r_H (Regime II; scope gate in V.Z) |
| Ringdown change-point (t_c, κ, ε_0) | Ringdown template family; prior π(κ), π(ε_0); waveform-systematics nuisance model; detector calibration model | Bayes factor for change-point vs GR-only (F1) + κ posterior band test (F2–F4) | Hyperbolicity/admissibility of the effective propagation sector holds in the modeled region; “late-time-inclusive” fit window is used (scope gate in V.Z) |
| CMB running dn_s/d ln k (and correlated pattern with r) | Cosmology mapping choices in V.I–V.M; foreground/systematic model class declared | Sign/magnitude exclusion for running (F7) + tensor suppression check (F8) | Cosmology-sector mapping is adopted as a model-locked module; analysis uses a stated parameter set (ΛCDM+running or extension) |
| Cross-observable consistency (Z_t, Z_s/Z_t) | Environment mapping ρ̄↔observable proxies; shared deformation channel assumption; redshift and delay datasets chosen | Joint-fit inconsistency test (F10) | Regime where both (i) clock-rate and (ii) propagation-delay observables are interpretable in the same environment class |

B.2 Make computations independently checkable (reproducibility)
• Provide a minimal reference implementation (even if toy) as a fixed-seed, end-to-end script that reproduces: G₂ → L_ρ → d_s(ℓ) → κ, Δd_s, plus the ringdown template fit on synthetic injections.
• Add a “Reproducibility capsule”: exact parameter file(s), random seeds, estimator definitions (especially for d_s), and a small set of sanity checks (e.g., plateau tests, convergence plots).

Reproducibility capsule (minimum contents).
• Version tag: PCT v51 (commit hash if applicable) and exact file list.
• Fixed seeds: RNG seed for any sampling over 𝒦, θ, or noise injections.
• Parameter file(s): locked Π parameters (σ_Π, backbone map), kernel parameters (η*, C₀, λ), deformation parameters (ρ̄_crit, ε), grid sizes (N_𝒦, N_M), and any estimator tolerances.
• Estimator definitions: exact discrete definition of Tr[exp(−ℓ²L_ρ)] and numerical differentiation used for d_s(ℓ), including smoothing/regularization choices.
• Sanity checks (minimum): (i) G₂ symmetry/PSD numerical check; (ii) hyperbolicity check Z_t>0, Z_s>0 on Ω; (iii) plateau detection test with declared tolerance; (iv) convergence plot under N_𝒦 refinement showing κ stability.

B.3 Strengthen robustness claims by turning them into executed internal tests
• Add a short internal “robustness report” section: show κ stability under (i) kernel-shape variations within M1, (ii) discretization change, (iii) projection-width perturbations, with the same extraction code.
• Ensure any “analytic derivation” (e.g., κ from 5 e-foldings) has a transparent derivation path and is cross-checked numerically in the same subsection.

Robustness report (minimum plots/tables).
• κ vs discretization family: finite-difference vs spectral vs random lattice (fixed physical scale and extraction window).
• κ vs kernel family perturbations: Gaussian/RBF vs exponential vs compact-support kernels satisfying M1 (with matched correlation length).
• κ vs σ_Π: small perturbations around the locked σ_Π with a declared “allowed” window, reporting Δκ and ΔΔd_s.
• Δd_s convergence: Δd_s(N_𝒦) with a continuum extrapolation and quoted uncertainty.

B.4 Improve empirical readiness (without claiming results)
• Ringdown: specify (i) which catalog(s) and event selection will be used, (ii) the exact likelihood (time-domain vs frequency-domain), (iii) treatment of start time t_0, and (iv) the null-injection suite required before interpreting Bayes factors.
• CMB: specify the exact parameter set used for falsification (e.g., ΛCDM+running vs extended), and declare which foreground/systematic robustness checks are required for claiming a “PCT-relevant exclusion.”

B.5 Clarify what would be learned from a negative result
• For each falsifier F1–F10, add a short “interpretation key”: does failure rule out (i) the microclass mechanism, (ii) the locked instantiation only, or (iii) a correspondence calibration (this mostly exists already in V.Z, but a one-paragraph summary here would improve readability).

Interpretation key (summary).
• Failures of F1–F6 primarily target the microclass discriminator mechanism (Π-threshold → d_s discontinuity → ringdown/analogue signatures); passing correspondence targets does not rescue a failed discriminator.
• Failures of F7–F8 falsify the cosmology-sector mapping as locked in V.I–V.M (a model-locked module), not necessarily the entire pregeometric reconstruction pipeline.
• Failure of F9 is a correspondence/calibration breakdown for the chosen Z_t,Z_s mapping (i.e., “this instantiation fails to reproduce GR in the IR”), not “new physics.”
• Failure of F10 falsifies the locked assumption that one shared deformation channel ρ̄→(Z_t,Z_s) is sufficient; it implies either additional degrees of freedom or a different deformation family, even if other modules remain viable.



Section VI. DISCUSSION 
This section consolidates scope, limitations, open problems, and conceptual implications that follow strictly from the constructions in this paper. Statements are bounded to what was defined or derived above. No empirical claims are made, and no uniqueness or correctness-in-nature is asserted beyond internal consistency. 
On circularity. A pregeometric framework must address whether it assumes spacetime concepts in its foundations. In PCT, correlations on 𝒦 are defined using only the kernel K(u,v)—symmetric, positive semi-definite—without invoking distance or metric. The manifold 𝓜 begins as a label space; its metric g_μν is derived from correlation decay (Theorem 5), not assumed. Lorentz symmetry emerges as a stability condition (Proposition 9), not an input. The framework has explicit inputs: the microclass axioms M1–M5, the calibration f(ρ̄) setting gravitational coupling, and normalization conventions. These are labeled throughout (see "Derived vs Calibrated" box, V.D). This parallels standard physics: QED derives electromagnetic interactions but requires α ≈ 1/137 from experiment; PCT derives the mechanism of gravity but requires G from calibration. 
VI.A Limitations 

Ecological-validity note (real-data idealizations; how failures would bias conclusions).
Several parts of the executable protocol (especially the d_s(\ell) and ringdown change-point modules) are presented in a cleaned, idealized form. In real datasets, the following idealizations can fail, typically biasing apparent “discriminator” signals upward (false positives) or making null results non-informative (false negatives) unless explicitly controlled.

(1) Noise model idealization (Gaussianity / correct PSD / independence).
The likelihoods and uncertainty estimates used in Sections V and Appendix C are written in a Gaussian-noise form with a power spectral density S_n(f) and an inner product ⟨a|b⟩. Real detector and experimental noise can be non-Gaussian, transient, and time-dependent (heavy tails, glitches, line wandering). Failure mode: a non-Gaussian tail can produce apparent late-time residual structure that mimics a change-point, inflating ln B in favor of the PCT template; or it can broaden posteriors so that κ becomes prior-dominated, weakening conclusions.

(2) Stationarity idealization (time-invariant noise and stable preprocessing).
Many steps assume approximate stationarity over the analysis window (PSD estimated off-source applies on-source; conditioning does not introduce nonstationary artifacts). If the noise or calibration drifts across the ringdown window, or if the experiment has slow drifts (analogue systems), then the “step vs smooth” decision can become a stationarity test rather than a physics test. Failure mode: spurious steps or apparent κ-shifts correlated with window choice, tapering, or PSD block selection.

(3) Simplified graph/operator priors (Laplacian surrogate is not uniquely defined from data).
When treating data as a weighted graph/Laplacian surrogate (for d_s(\ell) extraction), the mapping “data → W → L” is itself a modeling choice (edge construction, normalization, thresholding, boundary handling). If the prior over graph construction is overly restrictive (e.g., favors near-regular connectivity or a single kernel family), κ and Δd_s can become artifacts of that construction rather than invariants. Failure mode: apparent step location/magnitude changes materially under reasonable alternative graph priors or Laplacian conventions.

(4) Finite-refinement / finite-size idealization (continuum-limit behavior inferred from finite N).
Both discontinuity claims and null controls can be distorted at finite resolution: finite-size saturation can force d_s(\ell) → 0 at large \ell; numerical differentiation/smoothing can create or erase sharp features; and ℓ* extraction can drift with grid spacing. Failure mode: Δd_s that decreases toward 0 under refinement (false “discontinuity” at finite N), or an apparent κ that is stable only because the analysis window is implicitly tied to the discretization.

Operational implication (how this constrains interpretation).
A reported nonzero discriminator statistic (step/non-step preference, κ band preference, or ringdown ln B) should be treated as ecologically valid only after (i) explicit nonstationary/noise-model null controls (time slides, injections, and preprocessing variations), (ii) graph-prior / Laplacian / estimator swaps that preserve the claimed effect, and (iii) at least one refinement/size increase that demonstrates κ stability and nonzero limiting Δd_s.

This subsection is a dedicated limitations ledger. It is intentionally explicit about (i) what is not derived, (ii) what is fixed by hand (locked or calibrated), and (iii) where degeneracy with other theories or systematics can arise.

VI.A.0 Missing dynamics (explicit; what is absent, what would complete it, what does not depend on it) 
What is absent. This manuscript does not specify a unique intrinsic dynamical law on the primitives (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦, Π, Λ) that selects a history (K(τ_int), ρ_𝒦(τ_int), Π(τ_int), ν_Θ(τ_int)) from the admissible microclass. Concretely, the missing ingredient is an explicit evolution principle (equation of motion / variational principle / stochastic update rule) that (i) defines how K and ρ_𝒦 update in internal time τ_int, (ii) defines how (or whether) Π and ν_Θ evolve, and (iii) fixes how matter content in the emergent description sources the projected environment field ρ̄ (equivalently, a closure/source equation beyond the weak-field correspondence calibration used in V.D and the toy closure sketches in V.O).

VI.A.1 What is calibrated vs predicted (avoid “success-by-construction”).
To prevent ambiguity, the following are treated as correspondence calibrations or conventions in this manuscript (success here is necessary but not confirmatory):
• Weak-field mapping: f(ρ̄) ↔ r_s/r (and thus Newton’s G) (V.D).
• Any absolute scale-setting for converting dimensionless toy outputs to physical units (e.g., identifying ℓ_grid/N_𝒦 × r_H as a physical length scale; see units conventions).
• Entropy normalization η in S = ηA/(4ℓ_P²) unless explicitly derived (V.V).

Conversely, the following are intended as discriminator outputs (could fail): κ and Δd_s from the near-horizon d_s(ℓ) discontinuity module (V.G–V.J), the ringdown change-point structure tied to κ (V.G.15; V.Z F1–F4), and the cosmology-sector running prediction dn_s/d ln k (V.M.4; V.Z F7).

VI.A.2 Dependence on locked instantiation (variant dependence).
Several numerical outputs are produced only after “locking” one representative instantiation (V.A). This is done for reproducibility, not because the choice is claimed unique.
• If a discriminator fails, it matters whether it fails at the microclass/mechanism level (rules out PCT-as-defined-here) or only for the locked instantiation (rules out the canonical locked variant). The manuscript’s falsification checklist V.Z labels this explicitly (microclass vs locked-choice vs calibration).

VI.A.3 Degeneracy and mimicry risks (and what would actually distinguish PCT).
Even if a discriminator is well-defined, it can be mimicked by conventional physics/systematics or by alternative beyond-GR mechanisms. This manuscript treats degeneracy control as part of the claim.
• GW ringdown: potential mimics include start-time dependence, higher-mode/overtone mismodeling, detector calibration drift, and glitches. Distinguishing requirement: a change-point model with the predicted mass/spin scaling (κ dimensionless; t_c ∝ r_+) that passes multi-detector and off-source null tests (V.G.15; V.Z F1–F4).
• Analogue d_s(ℓ) measurements: potential mimics include finite-size saturation, estimator bias, and non-diffusive transport regimes. Distinguishing requirement: the step persists under estimator changes and refinement/size increases, with κ stable in the mapped dimensionless ratio ℓ*/r_H (V.K; V.Z F5–F6).
• CMB running: potential mimics include foreground/beam systematics and parameter degeneracies in extended cosmological models. Distinguishing requirement: the correlated pattern (enhanced negative running + suppressed r) persists under multi-frequency and extended-parameter robustness checks (V.M; V.Z F7–F8).
• “Cannot mimic” statements: whenever we state that GR+EFT cannot mimic a discontinuity, the statement is conditional on explicit baseline assumptions (A1–A6 in V.G.2). Relaxing those assumptions may allow mimicry, but at the cost of adding an explicit nonlocal/threshold mechanism; this is treated as an “accommodation cost” comparison, not as a logical impossibility claim.

VI.A.4 Degeneracy & “failure-to-meaning” map (what a negative result would actually mean).
A recurring failure mode in speculative frameworks is ambiguity about what exactly a negative result rules out (core mechanism vs a particular parameterization vs a calibration step). The table below provides an explicit “failure-to-meaning” mapping for the central PCT modules as presented here.

| Module / claim | What could mimic it (degeneracy class) | What breaks the degeneracy (required tests) | If it fails, what is falsified |
|---|---|---|---|
| κ-discontinuity in d_s(ℓ) (microclass discriminator) | Finite-size saturation; estimator bias; engineered nonlocal GR completions | Refinement + estimator swap + control runs; κ stability as a dimensionless ratio ℓ*/r_H (V.J; V.K; V.Z F5–F6) | The Π-threshold discontinuity mechanism as a microclass discriminator (not a correspondence calibration) |
| Ringdown change-point | Waveform systematics; start-time selection; glitches; calibration drift | Multi-detector consistency; off-source time slides; mass-independence of κ; spin scaling t_c/r_+ (V.G.15; V.Z F1–F4) | The claim that the κ-discontinuity imprints as a late-time change-point with universal κ |
| Cosmology running dn_s/d ln k | Foregrounds; extended-parameter degeneracies; inflationary prior choices | Multi-frequency robustness; extended-parameter robustness; check correlated pattern with r (V.M; V.Z F7–F8) | The model-locked cosmology mapping V.I–V.M (not necessarily the correlator-to-geometry pipeline) |
| Shared deformation channel ρ̄→(Z_t,Z_s) | Unmodeled degrees of freedom; environment mapping uncertainty | Joint-fit redshift + propagation-delay consistency in same environment class; explicit uncertainty propagation in ρ̄ mapping (V.W; V.Z F10) | The locked assumption that one shared deformation channel is sufficient (may require additional fields or different Z-family) |
| Weak-field correspondence (γ≈1; redshift scaling) | Experimental systematics; mapping ambiguity | Multiple weak-field tests cross-consistency (Shapiro delay + deflection + redshift) | Correspondence-calibration layer for the chosen Z-family (this is not “new physics,” but a failure to match the intended IR target) |

Interpretive rule (one sentence). A negative result for a discriminator is counted against the discriminator mechanism/module it targets (microclass vs locked-choice vs calibration), not “rescued” by the fact that correspondence targets were matched elsewhere.

What would count as a satisfactory completion. A completion would, at minimum, provide:
(1) A well-posed intrinsic update rule on 𝒦 (e.g., δS/δK = 0 and δS/δρ_𝒦 = 0 for a specified pregeometric action S[K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ], or a Markovian update kernel for (K,ρ_𝒦) in τ_int) such that solutions exist, are stable under small perturbations, and preserve the admissibility constraints (microcausality/hyperbolicity, no-signaling factorization, and microclass axioms M1–M5).
(2) A sourcing/closure principle that links matter-sector observables (in the emergent description) to ρ̄ (or directly to Z_t,Z_s), and yields the GR limit in a controlled regime (e.g., recovering Einstein-like dynamics, or a precisely defined deformation thereof, rather than only reproducing kinematic redshift and cone structure).
(3) A demonstrable correspondence limit: when coarse-grained to the IR, the completed dynamics reproduces the empirically tested sector (PPN, local QFT propagation) without fine-tuning beyond the explicitly declared calibrations.
(4) A clear statement of what is predicted vs calibrated vs gauge: ideally turning at least one currently calibrated mapping (e.g., f(ρ̄) ↔ r_s/r or an equivalent coupling normalization) into a derivable consequence of the intrinsic dynamics.

What the current results do NOT depend on. The following core results are kinematic/structural and do not require a completed intrinsic dynamics, beyond the explicitly stated regularity/admissibility assumptions:
• The correlation-distance reconstruction and metric-emergence theorems (Theorem 5 and related pipeline in III.D.6 / IV.A).
• The microcausality ↔ admissibility/hyperbolicity equivalence for the induced operator family (C2 / IV.B), as a selection constraint on allowed effective descriptions.
• The horizon definition as projection-volume collapse / loss of outward-compatible characteristic modes (C4 / IV.D), as an operational criterion.
• The end-to-end computability of the locked numerical protocol and the extraction of θ-invariant observables (Section V), conditional on the locked choices and the microclass axioms.

What the current results DO depend on. Any claim that requires time evolution of a concrete physical system (e.g., deriving Einstein dynamics rather than matching redshift kinematics, predicting a unique cosmological history rather than parameter-level signatures, or deriving the weak-field mapping without calibration) requires the missing intrinsic dynamics.

- Framework is primarily structural/kinematic in this manuscript 
The paper specifies (i) the pregeometric object set (correlation structures on (𝒦), and (ii) a projectionbased emergence map to an effective manifold 𝓜. It does not yet provide a complete fundamental law selecting a unique physical history among allowed correlation configurations. Dynamics enters through correspondence constraints: PCT constrains which dynamical laws are consistent with pregeometric foundations, rather than deriving unique dynamics from first principles. The effective generator L_ρ (Section IV.A) provides an emergent dynamical object, but its full equivalence to Einstein equations or QFT path integrals remains to be established. This kinematic-first approach parallels early thermodynamics (state functions before statistical mechanics) and is a deliberate methodological choice, not an oversight. 
- Non-uniqueness of projection families and emergence maps 
A given correlation state may admit multiple projection parameterisations that yield comparable effective geometries, or distinct effective geometries that remain observationally indistinguishable at coarse resolution. The present work does not provide a full classification of equivalence classes of projections or a uniqueness theorem for 𝓜. 
- Scale setting is not derived 
The formalism, as presented, does not fix absolute physical scales (e.g., length/time units, effective coupling strengths, horizon area units, vacuum energy scale). Any mapping between dimensionless correlation measures and dimensional quantities remains external to this manuscript. 
- Standard Model gauge structure is outside scope 
PCT derives spacetime geometry and gravitational structure from correlations. The gauge group U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3) and particle content (fermion generations, mass hierarchies) are not addressed. These require additional structure beyond the current framework and remain targets for future investigation. 
- Thermodynamic correspondence is partial 
PCT establishes several thermodynamic correspondences: (i) Area-entropy scaling S ∝ A emerges from dimensional reduction (V.P.7); (ii) Hawking temperature T_H = κ_surface/2π corresponds to the correlation update rate at the horizon—the rate at which projection configurations refresh sets a natural frequency ω_H = κc³/4πGM, yielding T_H via ℏω_H = k_B T_H [19]; (iii) The first law dM = T_H dS follows from conservation of correlation flux across the horizon boundary. However, deriving the complete thermodynamic identity set (second law, generalized second law, Page curve dynamics) from PCT axioms alone remains incomplete. The framework provides the kinematic structure for black hole thermodynamics; the dynamical completion requires specifying correlation update rules not fixed by M1– M5. 
- Computational tractability is limited at realistic sizes 
The correlation manifold and compatibility constraints scale rapidly with system size. This paper includes definitions and toy constructions, but not a mature, scalable numerical pipeline demonstrating convergence and robustness for large systems. 
- Model selection and falsifiability are not yet implemented 
The present paper establishes a formal framework and reformulations. It does not isolate a small set of quantitative observables that would discriminate PCT from GR/QFT within realistic measurement precision. 
- Regularity, measure-theory, and category-level subtleties are not fully formalised 
Certain steps rely on smoothness/regularity assumptions (explicit or implicit) for projection parameter families and for the emergent manifold interpretation. A fully rigorous measure-theoretic and functionalanalytic treatment is not completed here. 
 
VI.B Open Problems 

Open problems ranked by dependence (framework → locked theory).
(Arrows indicate “must be solved before this becomes meaningfully non-arbitrary / test-facing.”)

(1) Intrinsic dynamics on 𝒦 (well-posed update rule + stability) 
    → removes “static/kinematic-only” status 
    → enables calibration removal for at least one correspondence mapping 
    → yields tighter, non-tunable predictions.

(2) Projection-gauge principle / equivalence classes of (θ,Π,ν_Θ) 
    → separates gauge drift from physical variation 
    → defines what it even means to “lock” a theory rather than a parametrization.

(3) Coarse-graining / renormalisation map on primitives (𝒦,K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ) 
    → defines the IR limit unambiguously 
    → supplies scheme-invariant quantities (what survives admissible kernel/Laplacian conventions).

(4) Matter-sector interface + sourcing/closure (what plays “stress-energy” and how it drives ρ̄ or Z_{t,s}) 
    → turns geometry-only reconstruction into a coupled dynamical theory 
    → enables controlled GR/QFT recovery claims beyond kinematics.

(5) Calibration removal / scale setting (derive at least one currently-calibrated mapping) 
    → reduces free correspondence knobs 
    → upgrades discriminators from “protocol” to “prediction.”

(6) Minimal discriminating observable set + estimator/robustness guarantees (pre-registered decision rules) 
    → locks what is being tested (and what counts as null) 
    → supports credible model selection across datasets.

(7) Scalable numerics + convergence theorems (continuum/refinement control) 
    → makes the locked predictions computable at realistic sizes 
    → prevents “artifact-as-signal” failure modes.

- Define a minimal intrinsic dynamics on 𝒦 
Specify an evolution principle (variational, constraint-driven, stochastic, or algebraic) that operates on correlation states without presupposing spacetime, and show that the induced 𝓜 -level dynamics reproduces known effective laws in appropriate limits. 
- Uniqueness and gauge structure of emergence 
Formalise when two projection prescriptions are physically equivalent, identify the “gauge” redundancy of projection choices, and prove conditions under which emergent geometry is unique (up to diffeomorphism or an explicitly defined equivalence). 
- Derive effective locality and causal structure 
Provide sufficient conditions on correlation structure under which an emergent notion of causal ordering and approximate locality arises, and quantify when/where it fails. 
- Recover GR as a controlled limit 
Establish a theorem-level statement: under defined assumptions on correlation smoothness and projection stability, the emergent geometry satisfies Einstein-like dynamics (or a precisely characterised deformation), including well-posedness and conservation structure. 
- Recover QFT structure as a controlled limit 
Show how field degrees of freedom, vacuum structure, commutation relations (or their effective analogues), and correlation functions arise from correlation/projection data, including a clear account of what corresponds to “modes” and how effective linearity appears. 
- Black-hole sector: entropy, temperature, and information balance 
If horizons correspond to projection-compatibility collapse, derive quantitative thermodynamic relations from the correlation measures alone, and specify the precise statement of information conservation in the presence of projection constraints. 
- Determine a minimal set of discriminating observables 
Identify explicit measurable signatures (even if small) that differ from GR/QFT predictions, and state them in a form suitable for experimental or observational constraint. 
- Develop scalable numerical protocols 
Construct algorithms with demonstrable stability: sampling of 𝒦, computation of compatibility volumes, projection optimisation, and extraction of effective geometric quantities with uncertainty estimates. 
- Clarify the role of coarse-graining and renormalisation 
Define the analogue of coarse-graining on 𝒦, show how effective descriptions flow under it, and relate this to known renormalisation behaviour in emergent QFT regimes. 
- Mathematical completion 
Provide a rigorous account of existence/compactness conditions for compatibility volumes, define appropriate topologies on correlation state spaces, and prove convergence results for emergent 𝓜 under controlled limits. 

VI.B.* Risk register (conceptual risks + resolution plan) 
This short register lists the highest-leverage conceptual risks for PCT-as-presented-here and the concrete resolution steps (the “how we plan to resolve it” item is a commitment, not a completed result).

R1 — Λ underspecification risk (mediator freedom too broad). 
Risk: If Λ (ν_Θ) is too unconstrained, the framework may permit many observationally incompatible variants without a principled selection, weakening explanatory force. 
Plan: Promote the operational admissibility constraints (Λ-1…Λ-5, no-signaling factorization, record-stability) into a sharper selection principle (e.g., a maximum-robustness or maximum-record-stability criterion over ν_Θ), and require that discriminator observables (κ, Δd_s, change-point structure) be stable under admissible perturbations of ν_Θ (robustness-as-selection).

R2 — Non-uniqueness / gauge vs physics ambiguity. 
Risk: Distinguishing θ-gauge freedom from physically distinct model variants can be ambiguous, risking overcounting of degrees of freedom or mislabeling gauge drift as prediction. 
Plan: Formalize an equivalence relation on projection families (θ, Π) such that θ-invariant observables (d_s(ℓ), κ, curvature scalars, V_Π,out) define the physical content; treat only changes in dimensionless invariant relations as physical (cf. V.S) and require cross-observable consistency checks (V.Z; F10).

R3 — Continuum limit / discretization robustness. 
Risk: Discontinuity signatures (especially Δd_s) could be discretization artifacts or depend sensitively on kernel/Π choices outside the stated microclass. 
Plan: Enforce convergence under refinement as a non-negotiable internal test: (i) demonstrate Δd_s → Δd_s(∞) ≠ 0 and stable κ under N_𝒦 → ∞ (V.J); (ii) reproduce invariants across multiple discretizations and kernel shapes within M1 (V.G.8, V.J.3); (iii) publish a reference code path with fixed seeds and convergence diagnostics.

R4 — Calibration dependence masquerading as prediction. 
Risk: If too much phenomenology depends on correspondence calibrations (e.g., f(ρ̄) ↔ r_s/r, normalization conventions), “success” could be mistaken for confirmation. 
Plan: Maintain strict separation (parameter taxonomy table) and count only discriminator detections as confirmation; additionally, aim to derive at least one calibration mapping from the missing intrinsic dynamics (VI.A.0) to reduce the calibrated surface area.

R5 — Degeneracy with conventional physics/systematics in discriminators. 
Risk: Apparent detections (ringdown change-points, analogue d_s steps, CMB running) could be mimicked by waveform systematics, instrument/calibration drifts, finite-size effects, or cosmological foreground/parameter degeneracies. 
Plan: Make degeneracy control part of the prediction statement: require multi-detector and off-source null tests for ringdown, estimator/size controls for analogue systems, and multi-frequency/extended-parameter robustness for CMB; codify these as part of the falsification/confirmation protocol (V.Z; “Degeneracy control”).
 
VI.C Conceptual Implications 
The following implications are strictly interpretive consequences of the definitions and constructions in this paper, and should be read as reformulations rather than empirical claims. 
- Geometry is secondary to correlation structure 
The fundamental objects are pregeometric correlations on 𝒦. Spacetime geometry appears only after imposing projection compatibility and interpreting stable projection families as an effective manifold 𝓜. 
- Locality is not axiomatic 
“Nearness” is a derived notion associated with projection-stable correlation adjacency, rather than an input postulate. The framework therefore distinguishes between fundamental relational structure and emergent local neighbourhoods. 
- Horizon-like behaviour is a constraint phenomenon 
Regions identified as horizons correspond to regimes where outward-directed projection compatibility volume collapses (or becomes effectively inaccessible). This reframes horizon physics in terms of projection constraints rather than intrinsic singular behaviour of spacetime. 
- Singularity language becomes optional 
Since the primary description is on 𝒦, breakdowns of the emergent manifold description can be treated as failures of projection adequacy rather than as fundamental divergences. This is a change of description, not a demonstrated resolution of all singularity problems. 
- Information flow is fundamental; metric structure is representational 
The theory privileges information/correlation constraints as the primary substrate. Metric and causal structures are emergent summaries of stable correlation-projection patterns. 
- “Quantum” and “geometric” are not separate primitives in the formalism 
The framework is constructed so that correlation structure is the primitive and both quantum-like behaviour (nonclassical correlations) and geometric structure (effective 𝓜) arise from the same substrate, subject to future completion of dynamics and observable extraction. 
- Compatibility with known physics is a consistency target, not a claim of derivation 
Where the paper aligns with expected GR/QFT behaviours, this should be understood as an intended correspondence at the level of definitions and limiting interpretations. Full derivations remain open problems listed above. 
- Falsifiability depends on completing model selection 
PCT in this manuscript is a framework. It becomes a testable physical theory only once a specific dynamics, a projection gauge principle, and a set of discriminating observables are fixed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Conclusions  
Projective Correlation Theory (PCT) proposes a pregeometric foundation in which correlations and global compatibility constraints are ontologically primary. The theory is built around a constraint manifold 𝒦 equipped with a correlation kernel K, and a family of projection maps Π (parameterised by θ) into an emergent manifold 𝓜. Within this framework, spacetime geometry, quantum entanglement, and field propagators arise as projected features of correlation structure rather than as primitives. 
We provided (i) a measure-theoretic route to Born statistics by weighting outcomes according to the ρ_𝒦-measure of their preimage fibres in 𝒦, (ii) an explicit correspondence between kernel-based correlation structure and the Klein–Gordon propagator via inversion of the induced operator kernel, and (iii) a discrete toy model illustrating how compatibility structure induces outcome probabilities under projection. These results supply an explicit reconstruction pipeline and make the framework computationally usable, not only interpretive. 
We further formulated black holes as projection-collapse regions B ⊂ 𝓜, with horizons identified operationally as boundaries where outward-compatible projection volume V_Π,out falls to near zero. In this language, Hawking-like leakage is an exponentially suppressed boundary compatibility release, and the entropy–area correspondence is expressed as a boundary-multiplicity counting statement (with the overall normalization treated as a correspondence convention in this manuscript). 
Newly added observational context strengthens the paper’s “risk-bearing” character without changing its scope claims. In particular, (i) LVK’s fourth observing run concluded on 18 November 2025, and post-O4 data products/campaign catalogs enable independent late-time ringdown and population-level change-point tests of the κ-discontinuity module; and (ii) recent ACT DR6 cosmology results provide an additional, independent constraint set relevant to the magnitude of the running dn_s/d ln k predicted in the model-locked cosmology module. These data do not constitute confirmation by themselves, but they materially lower the barrier to executing the falsification programme stated in V.Z (F1–F10). 
The present work is not yet a complete replacement for relativistic quantum field theory or general relativity. In particular, a unique intrinsic dynamics on (𝒦, K, ρ_𝒦, Π, Λ) and a derived (rather than calibrated) weak-field coupling/closure remain open. However, with the primitives, scope gates, and discriminator-first checklist now explicitly specified, PCT is in a form where it can be ruled out decisively (or constrained into narrower variants) by targeted analyses of existing and near-term datasets.

Near-term contribution (reusable regardless of ultimate theory status). Independently of whether PCT’s discriminators are confirmed, the manuscript provides a reusable analysis artifact: a reference implementation for computing spectral dimension d_s(ℓ) from a weighted graph/Laplacian surrogate, together with step-vs-smooth diagnostics and robustness checks (estimator swaps, refinement stability). This supports immediate downstream use in analogue-gravity planning and in-silico studies that need a transparent, auditable pipeline from (W,L) to (d_s(ℓ),ℓ*,Δd_s,κ) with explicit null controls.

RESEARCH PROGRAM (NEXT PAPERS / EXPERIMENTS)

(1) Paper: “PCT in one page: a locked, falsification-first specification.” Produce a short companion that restates the full primitive object set, gates, and the Master falsification checklist (V.Z) with no narrative material, intended as the authoritative test-facing reference.

(2) Paper: “Reproducibility capsule v1: end-to-end κ/Δd_s with full provenance.” Package the discontinuity module as a fixed-seed, config-driven artifact that reproduces (i) d_s(ℓ), (ii) the step-vs-smooth model comparison, and (iii) (ℓ*,Δd_s,κ) across at least two discretizations and two kernel families, with an explicit no-horizon control.

(3) Experiment (in-silico analogue): “Horizon vs no-horizon control pair” executed to publication standard. Generate two matched graph/operator instances that differ only by the engineered near-horizon suppression, then show Δd_s≈0 in the control while κ remains stable in the horizon case under estimator swaps and refinement.

(4) Paper: “Scheme-independence audit for κ: kernel-family and Laplacian choices.” Systematically quantify how κ and Δd_s shift under admissible kernel choices (Gaussian/exponential/compact support) and Laplacian conventions (combinatorial vs normalized), and define an explicit “microclass-stable” subset where κ is invariant to tolerance.

(5) Paper + analysis: “LVK ringdown change-point pilot on a small curated event set.” Execute the Appendix C protocol end-to-end on a fixed pilot list (with full provenance), reporting per-event and stacked ln B and κ posteriors plus the null-control calibration tables.

(6) Experiment proposal: “Analogue spectral-dimension measurement with a no-horizon control.” Design a concrete analogue implementation (BEC or optical lattice) focused specifically on measuring a d_s(ℓ) curve with δℓ/ℓ*≲0.1, including an explicit control configuration that removes the engineered horizon/gradient to validate Δd_s≈0 under identical estimator settings.

(7) Paper: “Cross-channel κ consistency: link (d_s step) ↔ (ringdown change-point) in one dataset family.” Develop a joint inference framework that treats κ as a shared parameter across two observables (one d_s(ℓ)-like proxy and one late-time waveform proxy), with explicit criteria for declaring κ inconsistent across channels.

(8) Paper: “Matter/gauge embedding as an auditable map: minimal non-abelian sector.” Provide the first concrete PCT-native construction of a non-abelian gauge sector (even if toy), explicitly labeling which pieces are derived vs locked vs calibrated, and state at least one falsifiable low-energy consequence (e.g., an equivalence-principle violation channel or a coupling-running signature tied to ρ̄).

REPRODUCIBILITY CAPSULE (v60)

Purpose.
This capsule is a single “run me” index for the minimal executable toy instances used in the paper, including (i) exact script/file names, (ii) default seeds, (iii) hardware/runtime expectations, and (iv) headline sanity-check numbers that should match within tolerances.

A. Minimal, self-contained toy instance (spectral dimension from a weighted graph Laplacian).

What this reproduces.
• A deterministic toy $d_s(\ell)$ curve from a fixed 1D chain graph (n=40) with exponential weights.
• A coarse stability check under a trivial coarsening (pairwise node merging) reporting max |Δ d_s|.

Files.
• PCT/pct_ds.py  (standalone; NumPy-only)

Command.
• python PCT/pct_ds.py

Seeds / determinism.
• Default run is deterministic (exact eigendecomposition; no RNG used).
• If you modify the demo to use the Hutchinson estimator (estimator="hutch"), set rng_seed=0 and n_samples=64 for a fixed default.

Hardware/runtime expectation.
• CPU-only. On a typical laptop/desktop CPU, n=40 eigendecomposition should complete in < 1 second and < 100 MB RAM.

Expected headline outputs (sanity checks; tolerances).
The script prints a 25-row table of (ell, P(ell), d_s(ell)) plus one refinement diagnostic line.
Check:
• Monotonicity: P(ell) should be strictly decreasing over the printed ell grid.
• Small-scale trace: P(1.000e-01) ≈ 40 (expect 38–40; it approaches n as ell→0).
• Large-scale trace: P(1.000e+01) should be O(1) (expect 1.0–2.0; it approaches the number of connected components).
• Mid-scale dimension: d_s(ell) should be O(1) over roughly ell∈[3e-1,3e+0] (expect 0.8–1.2 in this 1D toy).
• Refinement diagnostic: max |Δ d_s| should be “small” (expect < 0.2 for this toy).

What to do if these checks fail.
• If P(ell) is not decreasing, confirm W is symmetric with zero diagonal and that L is constructed as stated (pct_ds.laplacian_from_adjacency).
• If d_s is extremely noisy, reduce the ell grid spacing or (for stochastic estimators) increase n_samples and keep the seed fixed.

B. Reproducibility scope note.
This capsule covers only the minimal self-contained toy instances available in-project (no external data). The LVK ringdown pilot (Appendix C) is intentionally not “one-click reproducible” in v60 because it depends on user-supplied local data paths and a GR waveform adapter; Appendix C nevertheless provides a fixed provenance ledger so that, once data access is provided, the run can be audited end-to-end.

COMMUNITY DELIVERABLES (REUSABLE OUTPUTS)

Purpose.
This section lists concrete, reusable outputs that other groups can adopt *without endorsing PCT*, and how to publish positive/negative results in a directly comparable way.

D.1 Code modules (reusable building blocks).
• Spectral-dimension pipeline (toy, NumPy-only): PCT/pct_ds.py
  - Inputs: weighted adjacency W (or kernel-defined weights) and a Laplacian convention.
  - Outputs: P(\ell), d_s(\ell), and the fixed step-finding protocol outputs (\ell*, Δd_s).
• Change-point inference scaffold (ringdown pilot): PCT/gw_change_point_runner.py, PCT/gw_change_point_pilot.py
  - Purpose: run the Appendix C statistic and produce the standardized output table fields.
• Cosmology one-number confrontation (running): PCT/planck2018_running_inference.py
  - Purpose: a fully specified worked example of a “numbers on the page” confrontation on an external published constraint.
• Execution index / run ledger: PCT/README_EXECUTION.md and the Reproducibility Capsule above.

D.2 Benchmark artifacts (minimal “known-answer” targets).
• Graph/Laplacian benchmark: the n=40 1D chain instance with the default weight rule used by pct_ds.py (sanity-check numbers in the capsule).
• Null controls: the “no-horizon / no-step” control configurations specified alongside each discriminator (e.g., Δd_s≈0 under matched estimator settings).
• Provenance-ledger template: Appendix C.1a is intended to be copied verbatim into papers so that data handling is auditable.

D.3 Falsifier checklists (standardized reporting).
• Master checklist: V.Z (F1–F10) is the consolidated set of discriminators and null tests.
• For each reported figure/table, publish the exact locked-choice IDs (V.A) and the gate status (BC1–BC5) on the analysis region Ω.

D.4 How others can publish results (negative or positive).
To make cross-paper comparisons meaningful, a third-party analysis should report:
• Configuration: the locked-choice ID set (V.A), the scale window [\ell_0,\ell_1], and Ω.
• Null calibration: show the control run(s) in the same paper (step-vs-smooth, or “no-horizon” pair), not only the headline discriminator.
• Outcome fields: at minimum (\ell*, Δd_s, κ) with uncertainty and the pre-registered decision rule from V.Z (PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE).
• Failure modes: if the analysis returns INCONCLUSIVE, state which gate(s) failed (BC1/BC2/…) and which data pathology drove it (finite resolution, missing data, nonstationary noise, truncation).

Interpretation rule.
• A negative result (null-consistent outcome under the standardized protocol) is publishable and informative: it rules out (or bounds) the tested variant family, independent of whether alternative PCT variants remain viable.

APPENDIX B: SPECULATION / NON-CLAIMS (OUT OF SCOPE FOR MAIN METHODS NARRATIVE)

Purpose.
This appendix quarantines programmatic, forward-looking, or high-uncertainty discussion so the main body can be read as a standard physics methods + discriminator paper.

B.1 Longer-horizon research directions (not near-term deliverables).
• Analogue-lab implementations (BEC / optical lattice) to measure a physical d_s(ℓ) step and κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H (requires experimental resources and careful control of finite-size/transport-regime systematics).
• Next-generation CMB constraints that decisively resolve dn_s/d ln k at the few×10^{-3} level (instrument/timeline dependent).

• No empirical detection claim: the observational modules are presented as falsifiable discriminator protocols with required null controls; executed confrontation on public data is limited and is not claimed as confirmation.

B.3 Interpretation rule.
Any statement in this appendix is to be read as (i) conditional on the scope gates (BC1–BC5) where applicable and (ii) subordinate to the main text’s falsifier-first reporting standard; nothing here upgrades the status of a claim.

B.4 Sensitivity appendix (alternatives moved out of the model-locked spec).
Purpose. Reduce apparent degrees of freedom in the main text by locking one default kernel family and one default projection family (Table PL.1), and collecting alternatives here for controlled sensitivity swaps.

B.4.1 Alternative kernel families $K$ (sensitivity-only).
When evaluating kernel-family sensitivity, keep all other run-card items fixed (including $\nu_\Theta$, $\Pi$, regularization, estimator variant, and window) and repeat the full discriminator pipeline.
• Matérn family (smoothness-controlled): $K_{\mathrm{Mat\acute ern}}(u,v)\propto \mathrm{Mat\acute ern}_{\nu}(d_{\mathcal K}(u,v)/\ell_K)$ (vary $\nu$ and $\ell_K$).
• Laplacian / exponential family (heavier tails): $K_{\exp}(u,v)=\exp(-d_{\mathcal K}(u,v)/\ell_K)$.
• Compact-support kernels (finite interaction range): e.g., Wendland-type kernels with cutoff radius $r_0$.

B.4.2 Alternative projection families $\Pi$ (sensitivity-only).
• Anisotropic Gaussian projections (elliptic kernels): width matrix $\Sigma_\Pi$ instead of scalar $\sigma_\Pi$.
• Mixture projections (multi-fiber / multi-modal pushforward): finite mixtures of Gaussians with mixture weights declared in the run card.
• Heavy-tail projections (robustness to outliers): e.g., Student-t projection kernels with degrees of freedom $\nu_{\Pi}$.

B.4.3 Reporting rule (required for any sensitivity run).
For each alternative family, report: (i) the full set of discriminator outputs $(\ell^*,\Delta d_s,\kappa)$ when defined, (ii) the full gate vector (BC1–BC5), and (iii) the decision-rule outcome (pass/fail / Bayes factor / \Delta\mathrm{AIC}) under the same declared null controls.

APPENDIX C: REPRODUCIBILITY CAPSULE (GW CHANGE-POINT TEST; V.G.15)

Scope. This appendix is intentionally minimal and is meant to be *executable as written* by an external reader. It specifies an input dataset slice, the model(s), the priors, the statistic, and the exact output fields to report. It does not claim a detection.

C.1 Data slice (pilot).
• Events: GW150914 and GW170814.
• Data product: public LVK open strain time series for each available detector.

C.1a Data provenance + preprocessing ledger (must be reported for each event and detector).
This table is part of the reproducibility capsule: the analysis is not considered reproduced unless these fields are filled.

| Event | Detector | Data used: LVK open-data release identifier (exact) | Strain segment GPS start | Strain segment GPS stop | Sampling rate (Hz) | PSD estimation segment (GPS start/stop or rule) | PSD method details (e.g., Welch segment length, overlap, window) | Bandpass (Hz) | Notches (Hz or list of line IDs) |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---|---|---|
| GW150914 | H1 | LOSC_4_V2 | 1126259446 | 32s | 4096 Hz | Welch (4s) | 30-500 Hz | 60 Hz notch | M_f=62±2.5 M_sun; κ=0.80; t_c=0.49±0.02 ms |
| GW150914 | L1 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| GW170814 | H1 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| GW170814 | L1 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| GW170814 | V1 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |

Notes (scope).
• “LVK open-data release identifier” should be the exact dataset/release string used to fetch the strain (and any accompanying calibration/quality products) so an external reader can fetch the identical data product.
• If data conditioning differs between detectors (e.g., different notch lists), it must be shown as separate entries (separate rows).

C.1b Implementation-complete analysis capsule (B.9a; GW ringdown change-point; fixed in v52).
This subsection fixes the analysis implementation details needed to make the ringdown inference reproducible, including the domain choice, frequency window, tapering, PSD estimation, and the precise time/mass conventions used to define the “200M” ringdown window.

Domain choice (time vs frequency).
• The likelihood is evaluated in the frequency domain using the standard Gaussian-noise inner product ⟨a|b⟩ = 4 Re ∫ (ã*(f)b̃(f)/S_n(f)) df (as already stated in V.G.15.2).
• The data are conditioned in the time domain (gating/windowing and bandpass filtering), then Fourier transformed for likelihood evaluation.

Fixed frequency band (per detector, unless explicitly overridden in the provenance table C.1a).
• f_min = 20 Hz.
• f_max = 1024 Hz.

Taper / window function (time-domain conditioning).
• Use a Tukey taper on the analyzed strain segment with Tukey parameter α_Tukey = 0.1 (10% cosine tapers on each edge).
• If any additional time-domain gating is applied (e.g., for glitches), it must be stated explicitly in the C.1a “PSD method details” field.

PSD estimation method and off-source segments (must be identical between GR-only and change-point models).
• PSD estimator: Welch’s method with Hann windows.
• Welch segment length: 8 s.
• Welch overlap: 4 s (50%).
• PSD frequency resolution: determined by the 8 s segment length.
• Off-source PSD segments: use two equal-duration off-source blocks per event per detector,
  – Pre-event block: [t_event − 1024 s, t_event − 64 s],
  – Post-event block: [t_event + 64 s, t_event + 1024 s],
  with the on-source exclusion buffer ±64 s chosen to avoid ring-in/down and data-quality transients near the event.
• If a detector lacks valid data for any portion of the stated off-source segments, the segment actually used must be recorded in C.1a (do not silently substitute a different PSD rule).

Definition of t_event and t_peak (so the “ringdown window” is reproducible).
• t_event (GPS): the event geocenter merger time provided in the LVK open-data package associated with the chosen “LVK open-data release identifier” in C.1a.
• t_peak (GPS): the geocenter time at which the absolute value of the GR-only maximum-likelihood template strain amplitude |h_GR(t)| attains its maximum in a narrow search window around t_event. Concretely:
  – Construct h_GR(t) at the geocenter using the GR baseline model used for inference (same approximant as in the evidence computation).
  – Define a search window [t_event − 0.05 s, t_event + 0.05 s].
  – Set t_peak := argmax_{t in window} |h_GR(t)|.
• The detector-frame peak times are then t_peak,det = t_peak + Δt_geo→det, with the time delay computed from the event sky location used in the GR baseline model for that event.

Definition of M and the “200M” window (so the time window length is reproducible).
• M is the remnant (final) mass M_f for the event, taken from the publicly released LVK parameter-estimation posterior samples for that event (median value used for the deterministic “200M” window definition; uncertainty is propagated in parameter inference separately).
• Conversion to seconds: one mass unit is
  1M := G M_f / c^3 = 4.92549095 × 10^{−6} s × (M_f / M_⊙).
• The “200M” window duration is then:
  ΔT_200M := 200M = 200 × (G M_f / c^3).

Ringdown analysis window definition.
• The ringdown analysis window is defined relative to t_peak:
  – t_0 := t_peak + Δt_0,
  – t_1 := t_0 + ΔT_200M,
  where Δt_0 is the (marginalized) ringdown-start offset (the t_0 prior already specified in Appendix C.3).
• The reported “Ringdown fit window [t_0, t_1] (GPS)” in Table C.5a must be computed using the above convention (t_peak definition + M_f-to-seconds conversion + 200M duration), so an external reader can regenerate identical endpoints.

C.2 Models compared.
• Baseline (GR-only): h_GR(t).
• Change-point (PCT template family): h_PCT(t) = h_GR(t)[1+ε(t)], with ε(t)=0 for t<t_c and ε(t)=ε_0 exp(−(t−t_c)/τ_d) for t≥t_c, and t_c(M,a*) = κ r_+(M,a*)/c (V.G.15).

C.3 Priors (fixed for the pilot confrontation).
• π(κ) = Uniform[0.75, 0.85].
• π(ε_0) = Uniform[0.01, 0.03].
• Ringdown start time prior π(t_0): Uniform[t0_min, t0_max], with the chosen (t0_min, t0_max) recorded in the results table.

C.4 Likelihood and statistic.
• Likelihood: Gaussian noise with PSD S_n(f).
• Statistic to report: Bayes factor B(change-point|GR-only) OR equivalently Δln Z.

C.5 Mandatory outputs to report (per-event, then combined).

C.5a Compact results table (instantiate with the provenance fields above; outcomes may be “TBD”).

Execution artifact (project file). The project file PCT/gw_change_point_pilot.py is a minimal external script scaffold intended to run this Appendix C pilot (data-local; no downloads) and to produce the result and null-control tables below once the user supplies local LVK data paths and a GR ringdown model adapter.

Status note (v52). The computations below are intended to be executed on the stated LVK open-data products using the exact preprocessing/provenance ledger in C.1a; until executed, all numeric entries remain explicitly marked as TBD.

| Event | Detectors | Data used: LVK open-data release identifier(s) used | Ringdown fit window [t_0, t_1] (GPS) | t_0 prior [t0_min, t0_max] (GPS) | Bandpass + notches (reference to C.1a) | Δln Z = ln Z_PCT − ln Z_GR | ln B = ln(B(PCT|GR)) | κ median | κ 90% CI |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| GW150914 | H1,L1 | TBD | TBD | TBD | C.1a | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| GW170814 | H1,L1,V1 | TBD | TBD | TBD | C.1a | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Combined | (stacked) | TBD | TBD | TBD | C.1a | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |

C.6 Minimal internal null controls (required to interpret Bayes factors).
C.6.1 GR-only injections (false-positive rate calibration; B.9a).
Purpose.
Estimate the distribution of ln B under the GR-only null so that any positive ln B observed in real data can be interpreted as “signal” vs “false positive.”

Decision rule under the null (false-positive criterion).
Declare a false positive if the analysis reports ln B > ln B_thr for a GR-only injection, where ln B is the Bayes factor for the PCT-augmented change-point model against the GR baseline under identical analysis settings.

C.6.1a Injection distribution (population + priors).
All injections are GR-consistent BBH ringdowns parameterized by (m_1,m_2, \chi_1, \chi_2, \Omega, \iota, \psi, \phi_c, t_c, D_L) (or equivalently by chirp mass \mathcal{M} and mass ratio q where stated).

Priors (define one population; do not mix populations within the same N=500 set).
• Masses.
  – Primary mass m_1: Uniform[m_{1,\min}, m_{1,\max}].
  – Mass ratio q := m_2/m_1: Uniform[q_{\min}, 1].
  – (Alternative parameterization allowed: (\mathcal{M}, q) with \mathcal{M} Uniform[\mathcal{M}_{\min}, \mathcal{M}_{\max}] and q Uniform[q_{\min}, 1].)
• Spins.
  – Spin magnitudes \chi_1, \chi_2: Uniform[0, \chi_{\max}].
  – Spin tilts (cosines): cos\theta_1, cos\theta_2: Uniform[−1,1] (isotropic tilts).
  – Spin azimuths: \phi_1, \phi_2: Uniform[0,2\pi].
• Sky location and orientation.
  – Right ascension \alpha: Uniform[0,2\pi].
  – Declination \delta: cos\delta Uniform[−1,1] (isotropic sky).
  – Inclination \iota: cos\iota Uniform[−1,1].
  – Polarization \psi: Uniform[0,\pi].
  – Coalescence phase \phi_c: Uniform[0,2\pi].
• Coalescence time within the analysis window.
  – t_c: Uniform[t_0 + \Delta t_{c,\min},\ t_0 + \Delta t_{c,\max}] where [t_0,t_1] is the ringdown window and \Delta t_{c,\min}, \Delta t_{c,\max} are fixed offsets reported in the null-run ledger (e.g., a narrow range inside the first 10M of the window).
• Distance / redshift.
  Choose exactly one of:
  (A) Astrophysical distance prior: uniform in comoving volume with z \le z_{\max} (with cosmology stated), or
  (B) Uniform in luminosity distance: D_L Uniform[D_{\min}, D_{\max}], or
  (C) Direct network-SNR targeting: \rho_net Uniform[\rho_{\min}, \rho_{\max}] with truncation bounds stated; implement by solving for D_L per injection (holding other parameters fixed) to match the target \rho_net under the chosen PSD.

Required reporting: whichever choice is used, report the implied (or explicitly targeted) network SNR distribution summary (median and 10%/90% quantiles for \rho_net), because the false-positive behavior can depend on SNR.

C.6.1b Injection generation (waveforms + noise + conditioning).
Waveform model.
• Use a GR waveform approximant consistent with the GR baseline model used in the Bayes-factor comparisons (so that injections do not bake in model mismatch).
• Specify (must be filled): approximant name, whether higher modes are included, whether precession is included, and the reference frequency f_ref.

Data model and noise.
Choose exactly one of:
(A) Real noise injections.
• Add injections to real off-source strain segments.
• Segment selection: choose segments that pass the same data-quality requirements as the on-source analysis; state how segments are selected (GPS rules, veto categories, stationarity criteria).
• PSD: estimate S_n(f) using the same Welch method and off-source rules as in C.1b.
(B) Simulated Gaussian noise.
• Generate Gaussian noise colored by a stated PSD S_n(f).
• PSD choice: (i) an event-specific PSD estimated from neighboring data (Welch), or (ii) a fixed representative PSD; in both cases state whether PSD is held fixed across injections or re-estimated per injection/segment.

Sampling and conditioning (must match the real-data analysis).
• Sampling rate: use the same sampling rate as the on-source analysis (record in C.1a).
• Frequency band: use the same f_min, f_max as the on-source analysis.
• Conditioning: apply the same bandpass/notches, the same taper/windowing (Tukey α=0.1 unless overridden), and the same ringdown window definition/marginalization as in Appendix C.

C.6.1c Threshold setting (target FPR and calibration/holdout).
Target false-positive rate.
• Set target FPR := 1% (default for the pilot).

Threshold choice.
• Choose ln B_thr as the 99th percentile of the null ln B distribution.

Validation protocol.
• State whether ln B_thr is set using the same N=500 injections (“single-sample”) or by a split procedure:
  – Calibration set N_cal (e.g., 250) used to set ln B_thr,
  – Holdout set N_hold (e.g., 250) used only to estimate achieved FPR.

C.6.1d Null-run results schema (what must be reported).
Mandatory outputs to report.
• N injections and a brief summary of injection-population choices (mass/spin/distance/SNR).
• ln B_thr and how it was set (percentile + calibration/holdout).
• Estimated false-positive rate \hat{p} := #{ln B > ln B_thr}/N with an explicit binomial uncertainty/CI.
• Histogram and key quantiles of ln B under the null (at least: 50%, 90%, 95%, 99%).
• A short calibration/stability summary under reasonable analysis variations (PSD choice/estimation, start-time prior width, and one additional robustness variation), stating whether ln B_thr and the null ln B distribution are stable.

Compact reporting table (minimum).

| Null type | N trials | ln B_thr (definition) | False-positive rate \hat{p} | 95% binomial CI for p | Median ln B | 90% range of ln B |
|---|---:|---|---:|---|---:|---:|
| GR-only injections | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |

C.6.2 Off-source time slides (glitch/control).
• Purpose: test whether the pipeline yields spurious preferences for the change-point model from non-astrophysical noise transients.
• Procedure: analyze off-source segments/time slides through the identical pipeline and report the resulting ln B distribution.
• Mandatory outputs to report:

| Null type | N trials | Segment definition (GPS/rule; reference C.1a) | ln B threshold used | False-positive rate | Median ln B | 90% range of ln B |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Off-source time slides | TBD | C.1a | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |

APPENDIX D: HOW TO USE THIS PAPER TO RUN THE TESTS (ONE-PAGE)

Purpose. This appendix is a minimal operator’s guide. It lists (i) required inputs, (ii) the execution steps (“commands,” conceptual if code is not bundled), (iii) expected outputs, and (iv) common failure modes. It does not claim any empirical result.

D.1 GW RINGDOWN CHANGE-POINT TEST (V.G.15; V.Z F1–F4)

Inputs.
• Events: a chosen list of GW events with usable ringdown SNR (pilot slice: GW150914, GW170814).
• Data used identifier: the exact LVK open-data release identifier(s) used to fetch strain and any accompanying calibration/quality products (recorded per detector; see Appendix C.1a).
• Preprocessing specification: bandpass, notches, sample rate, and PSD estimation method + off-source segment definition (Appendix C.1a).
• Model choices: GR-only baseline waveform model h_GR(t) and PCT change-point family h_PCT(t)=h_GR(t)[1+ε(t)] with priors π(κ), π(ε_0), and start-time prior π(t_0) (Appendix C.2–C.4).

Commands (conceptual).
1) Fetch data: download the strain time series for each event and detector using the recorded LVK open-data release identifier(s).
2) Condition data: apply the recorded bandpass/notches; estimate PSD S_n(f) using the recorded method and off-source segment.
3) Define ringdown window: choose a fit window [t_0, t_1] with t_0 marginalized over a stated prior interval.
4) Run inference:
   • Compute evidence Z_GR for h_GR(t) and evidence Z_PCT for h_PCT(t) over priors κ∈[0.75,0.85], ε_0∈[0.01,0.03].
   • Report Bayes factor B(PCT|GR)=Z_PCT/Z_GR (or Δln Z) per event and for the stacked combination.
5) Run null controls:
   • GR-only injections and/or off-source time slides through the identical pipeline.

Expected outputs.
• Per event: Bayes factor B(PCT|GR), κ posterior (median + 90% CI), ε_0 posterior (optional), and a short start-time sensitivity summary.
• Combined/stacked: combined κ posterior and combined Bayes factor.
• Provenance ledger: the Appendix C tables completed (data used identifiers, GPS segments, PSD settings, bandpass/notches).

Common failure modes.
• Start-time dependence: κ or B(PCT|GR) changes materially when widening/narrowing the t_0 prior → indicates waveform-systematics sensitivity.
• Detector inconsistency: κ posteriors disagree across detectors for the same event beyond uncertainty → suggests calibration/glitch contamination.
• False positives in null controls: off-source time slides or GR-only injections yield B(PCT|GR) above the chosen detection threshold too often → indicates an under-modeled noise/systematics channel.
• Non-universality: κ shows a significant trend with mass/spin across events → falsifies the “dimensionless invariant” claim (V.Z F3).

D.2 SPECTRAL-DIMENSION STEP TEST (V.G; V.J; V.Z F5–F6)

Inputs.
• Graph or kernel-defined structure: a weighted adjacency matrix W (graph Laplacian input) or an explicit rule to construct W from a kernel K(u,v).
• Scale grid: a list of length scales {ℓ_i} spanning the candidate transition window with sufficient resolution (target: δℓ/ℓ* ≲ 0.1).
• Estimator choice: exact eigendecomposition (“eig”) for small graphs, or a stochastic trace estimator (“hutch”) for larger graphs.
• Refinement family: at least one controlled refinement/coarsening procedure to test stability of d_s(ℓ) (e.g., increasing node count N or applying a coarsening map).

Commands (reference implementation).
• Run the reference code in PCT/pct_ds.py on your chosen W and {ℓ_i}:
  1) build L from W,
  2) compute P(ℓ)=Tr(exp(-ℓ^2 L)),
  3) compute d_s(ℓ)= -2 d ln P / d ln(ℓ^2),
  4) repeat under estimator swap (eig ↔ hutch) and under refinement/coarsening.

Expected outputs.
• A table or curve of d_s(ℓ) across {ℓ_i}.
• A step summary: inferred ℓ* location (if present) and step size Δd_s (pre/post values).
• Robustness diagnostics: max |Δ d_s(ℓ)| under estimator swap and under refinement/coarsening.

Common failure modes.
• Finite-size saturation: d_s(ℓ) decays toward 0 at the largest ℓ because the graph is finite → restrict analysis to the pre-saturation window.
• Estimator artifacts: the apparent step disappears under estimator swap (eig vs hutch) → indicates numerical/estimator bias.
• Non-convergence under refinement: Δd_s decreases toward 0 as N increases → indicates a discretization artifact rather than a stable feature.
• Misidentified “near-horizon” regime: the tested region/graph does not satisfy the near-horizon suppression diagnostics used to justify applying the κ/Δd_s discriminator module.


APPENDIX E: POSITIONING & OUTREACH (ADOPTION / CITATION FRICTION REDUCTION)

Purpose. Make it easy for readers to place this work, cite it appropriately, and reuse it as a *toolkit* even if they reject PCT’s ontology. This appendix is positioning-only; it does not claim empirical support.

E.1 Closely related papers / programs (with one-sentence differentiation)
(Use as “Related work” scaffolding; replace bracketed tags with the paper’s numbered bibliography keys.)

1) Causal set theory (classical + dynamics reviews) [REF: causal-sets-review].
   Differentiation: causal sets take a partial order as primitive and typically focus on correspondence/continuum recovery, whereas PCT’s primitives are a PSD kernel + explicit stochastic projection and its core discriminator is a *finite-ℓ* discontinuity* in d_s(ℓ) with explicit step-vs-smooth null tests.

2) Causal dynamical triangulations (CDT) spectral dimension running [REF: cdt-ds-running].
   Differentiation: CDT’s d_s(ℓ) behavior is usually presented as a smooth scale-dependent flow in a triangulated path integral, whereas PCT predicts and operationalizes a *non-analytic step* at a universal κ that is explicitly tested against smooth alternatives under estimator/refinement sweeps.

3) Asymptotic safety / FRG spectral dimension results [REF: asymp-safety-ds].
   Differentiation: asymptotic safety derives dimensional flow from a metric QFT fixed point, while PCT treats metric structure as *induced* from correlators and ties the transition scale to a second, independent discriminator (GW ringdown change-point) rather than only to UV fixed-point behavior.

4) Hořava–Lifshitz gravity / anisotropic scaling phenomenology [REF: horava-lifshitz].
   Differentiation: Hořava–Lifshitz modifies microscopic symmetry and dispersion directly, whereas PCT’s effective dispersion changes are downstream of a projection-collapse mechanism and are scope-gated by BC2/BC3 (hyperbolicity + IR locality) rather than assumed.

5) Tensor-network / entanglement-to-geometry programs (e.g., MERA / RT-motivated reconstructions) [REF: tn-geometry].
   Differentiation: those approaches often start from entanglement structure and (sometimes) a boundary/bulk duality intuition, whereas PCT starts from a kernel on a constraint space 𝒦 plus a declared projection Π and treats geometry reconstruction as an executable correlator-distance map with explicit failure modes (NG1–NG5).

6) Graph/complex-network spectral dimension methodology papers [REF: graph-ds-methods].
   Differentiation: general graph d_s(ℓ) work provides estimators and asymptotics, while PCT contributes an end-to-end *decision protocol* (step extraction rule, θ-stability audits, adversarial baselines, and claim-permission gates) designed to prevent false “geometry” narratives.

7) GW ringdown tests of GR (parameterized deviations; stationary fits) [REF: ligo-ringdown-tests].
   Differentiation: standard tests target stationary (time-independent) deviations in QNM parameters, whereas PCT’s core GW discriminator is explicitly *nonstationary* (a late-time change-point) with a universal scaling t_c(M,a*)/r_+(M,a*) that is not the target of the usual parameterized frameworks.

8) GW echoes / exotic compact object late-time phenomenology [REF: echoes-searches].
   Differentiation: many echo models posit reflective structure at (or near) the would-be horizon, whereas PCT predicts a weak late-time residual tied to κ and requires cross-event universality and matched null controls (time slides + GR-only injections) as the primary discriminant.

E.2 “How to cite this paper” (one paragraph)
If you use only the reusable methods (e.g., d_s(ℓ) estimator protocol, step-vs-smooth comparison, θ-stability audits, or the ringdown change-point Bayes-factor scaffold), cite this work as a methods/pipeline source (Appendix D/F; V.Z) rather than as evidence for quantum gravity. If you use the specific PCT discriminator predictions (κ band, t_c/r_+ scaling, running band), cite it as a falsifiable phenomenology proposal with explicit null tests.

E.3 Reproducibility package (data sources + code/pseudocode)

Goal. Lower adoption friction by making the minimum runnable artifacts explicit.

Data sources (public; record exact release IDs in Appendix C tables).
• GW: LVK Open Science Center strain products for selected events and detectors (Appendix C.1a; Appendix D.1).
• CMB (if running the cosmology capsule): Planck 2018 likelihood chains/products used in V.M (record exact product IDs in Appendix C when executed).
• Synthetic / in-silico artifacts shipped with this project: PCT/data/gw_synth_monthly.csv and (optional) PCT/data/H-H1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5 (used only for pipeline smoke tests unless explicitly upgraded).

Code / pseudocode (this repository).
• Spectral-dimension pipeline core: PCT/pct_ds.py (heat-trace + d_s(ℓ) estimation utilities).
• GW change-point pilot and runners: PCT/gw_change_point_pilot.py, PCT/gw_change_point_runner.py, PCT/lvk_ringdown_end_to_end.py.
• Capsule go/no-go and reporting scaffolds: PCT/gw_capsule_go_nogo.py and PCT/README_EXECUTION.md.
• Optional auxiliary demos: PCT/analogue_ds_artifact.py, PCT/planck2018_running_inference.py.

Minimum “it runs” deliverable (suggested bundle).
• A single command-line entrypoint (or documented sequence) that:
  (i) computes d_s(ℓ) on a provided W/K example and returns (ℓ*, Δd_s, κ) with the robustness suite (estimator swap + refinement), and
  (ii) runs the GW change-point Bayes-factor pipeline on one named public event with at least one null control.

Reproducibility checklist (what must be recorded).
• Environment: Python version + key package versions; random seeds; CPU/GPU flags if relevant.
• Provenance: exact data release IDs, GPS segments, PSD method, bandpass/notches, and priors used (Appendix C).
• Outputs: a minimal results JSON/CSV + plots plus the null-distribution summaries for ln B (Appendix C.6).

APPENDIX F: PRACTICAL METHODS (PIPELINE CHECKLISTS)

Purpose. This appendix is a short, execution-oriented checklist for the paper’s main analysis pipelines. It lists: inputs, preprocessing, commands (conceptual if code is absent), expected outputs, and common failure modes. It does not claim results.

F.1 Pipeline A — Spectral-dimension discontinuity (d_s(ℓ), ℓ*, κ, Δd_s)  [V.G; V.J; V.Z F5–F6]

Inputs.
• A weighted graph / kernel realization: either an adjacency/weight matrix W or an explicit kernel K(u,v) plus a rule for constructing W.
• A Laplacian/operator choice: L (e.g., combinatorial Laplacian L=D−W or normalized Laplacian).
• A scale grid {ℓ_i} spanning the candidate transition region with resolution δℓ/ℓ* ≲ 0.1.
• Horizon-scale proxy r_H (or analogue r_H) if κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H is to be reported.

Preprocessing.
1) Build W (and then L) using a stated convention; record which convention is used.
2) Basic sanity checks: W symmetric; nonnegative weights; degree matrix D well-defined; L has nonnegative spectrum (or numerically stable heat semigroup).
3) Choose a “pre-saturation” ℓ-window (finite-size saturation at large ℓ must be excluded from step claims).

Commands (conceptual).
1) Compute P(ℓ)=Tr(exp(−ℓ^2 L)) over {ℓ_i}.
2) Compute d_s(ℓ)=−2 ∂ ln P / ∂ ln(ℓ^2) using a stated numerical derivative/smoothing method.
3) Extract (ℓ*, Δd_s) using the fixed extraction rule (V.G.5).
4) Robustness suite (required):
   • estimator swap (eig ↔ Hutchinson),
   • at least one refinement/size increase,
   • a no-horizon / no-critical control run (same estimator settings).

Expected outputs.
• d_s(ℓ) curve (plot and/or table).
• Step summary: ℓ* with uncertainty, Δd_s with uncertainty.
• κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H with uncertainty (if r_H is defined and reported).
• Step/non-step statistic (e.g., ΔAIC or ≥3σ step test) plus the same statistic for the no-horizon control.

Common failure modes.
• Finite-size saturation masquerading as a step (d_s→0 at large ℓ).
• Numerical-derivative noise or smoothing choice induces spurious discontinuity.
• Step disappears under estimator swap or refinement (artifact rather than microclass feature).
• κ reported without a defensible r_H proxy (cannot compare across systems).


F.2 Pipeline B — GW ringdown change-point inference (κ, ε_0; Bayes factor vs GR)  [V.G.15; Appendix C; V.Z F1–F4]

Inputs.
• Ringdown-ready strain data (or whitened strain + PSD) per event and detector.
• Provenance ledger fields (event IDs, detector list, GPS segments, sampling rate, bandpass/notches, PSD method) as in Appendix C.1a.
• A GR baseline ringdown model h_GR and a change-point family h_PCT(t)=h_GR(t)[1+ε(t)].
• Priors: κ∈[0.75,0.85], ε_0∈[0.01,0.03], and a ringdown start-time prior π(t_0).

Preprocessing.
1) Apply the declared bandpass and notch list.
2) Estimate PSD S_n(f) using the declared Welch settings and off-source segments.
3) Define ringdown windowing relative to t_peak and M_f (Appendix C.1b), and ensure t_0 is marginalized (do not hard-fix t_0 unless explicitly stated).

Commands (conceptual).
1) For each event: compute evidence (or likelihood) under GR-only and under the change-point family; report Δln Z or ln B.
2) Infer κ posterior (median + 90% CI), optionally ε_0 posterior.
3) Stack events (state stacking rule) to obtain combined κ posterior and combined Bayes factor.
4) Null controls (required before interpreting ln B):
   • GR-only injections (N=500) to set ln B_thr,
   • off-source time slides,
   • at least one waveform/systematics swap.

Expected outputs.
• Completed results table (Appendix C.5a): per-event and combined Δln Z/ln B and κ posterior summary.
• Completed null-control tables (Appendix C.6.1 and C.6.2) and the chosen ln B_thr.
• A short sensitivity summary: κ and ln B stability under start-time prior widening, PSD choice, and one additional nuisance sweep.

Common failure modes.
• Start-time dependence dominates: κ drifts or ln B changes sign under reasonable π(t_0) changes.
• Detector inconsistency: κ posteriors disagree across detectors beyond uncertainty.
• Elevated false positives in null controls: ln B_thr not stable, or off-source exceedance rate is too high.
• Apparent signal is driven by a single event or a single detector (not robust in stacking).


F.3 Pipeline C — CMB running inference capsule (dn_s/d ln k)  [V.M.4; V.Z F7–F8]

Inputs.
• A specified likelihood combination (e.g., Planck 2018 TT/TE/EE + low-ℓ + lensing).
• A parameter set: ΛCDM+running (and declared extensions for robustness).
• Priors, sampler choice, and convergence thresholds (e.g., \hat R < 1.01 and ESS ≥ 1000).

Preprocessing.
1) Fix likelihood components and foreground/systematic model choices; record exact component names/config.
2) Fix priors (especially dn_s/d ln k prior range) and convergence criteria.

Commands (conceptual).
1) Run parameter inference for dn_s/d ln k under the baseline model.
2) Run robustness checks: allow one-at-a-time extensions (Ω_k, Σm_ν, N_eff) and repeat.
3) Report whether the PCT predicted band (−0.012 ± 0.005) lies within the inferred 68% and 95% intervals.

Expected outputs.
• Posterior summary for dn_s/d ln k (mean/median + 68% and 95% credible intervals).
• Robustness summary: shifts in dn_s/d ln k under the extended parameter sets.
• A one-line “pass/fail” statement against the falsifier thresholds (V.Z F7) once a dataset is chosen.

Common failure modes.
• Non-convergence (\hat R not met; low ESS) makes the posterior unreliable.
• Posterior is dominated by prior edges (insufficient constraining power).
• Running signal flips sign or shifts materially under standard extensions (degeneracy rather than model-relevant signal).


APPENDIX G: REPRODUCIBILITY CAPSULE (ALL FIGURES / TABLES / NUMBERS)

Scope and intent.
This appendix is the global “how to reproduce everything” capsule. It is intended to be executable without reading the full paper line-by-line.

Definition (reproduced result).
A figure/table is “reproduced” only if (i) the same inputs (data/provenance + configs) and (ii) the same code path (scripts + versions) yield (iii) the same values to within the stated numerical tolerances.

G.0 Required artifacts (what must exist in the project bundle)
G.0.1 Mandatory code artifacts (project files).
• PCT/pct_ds.py  (spectral dimension d_s(ℓ) from a Laplacian surrogate).
• PCT/gw_change_point_pilot.py  (ringdown change-point capsule scaffold; Appendix C).

G.0.2 Mandatory non-code artifacts.
• One configuration file per pipeline run (see G.2 and the per-result tables below).
• A fixed-seed RNG policy (see G.3).
• A “run manifest” for each reproduced result, containing:
  – input provenance (dataset IDs or generated-instance parameters),
  – config values (all hyperparameters),
  – code versions (Python and key packages),
  – checksums of any binary inputs (if used),
  – output filenames and summary statistics.

G.0.3 Minimum reproducibility environment (reference).
Unless explicitly overridden in a per-result capsule:
• Numerical precision: float64.
• OS/CPU: any (must report).
• Python: 3.9+.
• Dependencies: NumPy, SciPy.
• Randomness: seeded deterministically (see G.3).

G.1 Global conventions used across all pipelines
G.1.1 Naming conventions.
• “W” = weighted adjacency matrix.
• “L” = Laplacian/operator used for diffusion/heat trace.
• “P(ℓ)” = heat trace / return probability proxy.
• “d_s(ℓ)” = spectral dimension curve computed from P(ℓ).

G.1.2 Operator/Laplacian convention.
Unless explicitly overridden:
• Use the combinatorial Laplacian L := D − W.
• For normalized alternatives (scheme swaps), record L_norm := I − D^{−1/2} W D^{−1/2} explicitly.

G.1.3 Definition of d_s(ℓ) (canonical discrete estimator).
Given a discrete scale grid {ℓ_i}:
1) Compute P(ℓ_i) := Tr(exp(−ℓ_i^2 L)).
2) Compute log-slope on the same grid by a local linear fit in log-space:
   • Let x_i := ln(ℓ_i^2) and y_i := ln(P(ℓ_i)).
   • For each interior i, fit y ≈ a + b x on a symmetric window of width w_pts (odd integer).
   • Set d_s(ℓ_i) := −2 b.
Default w_pts = 5.

G.1.4 Numerical tolerance policy (default).
Unless overridden per table/figure:
• Scalar values (κ, Δd_s, etc.): reproduce within absolute tolerance 1e−2 OR within 2×(quoted 1σ uncertainty), whichever is larger.
• Curves (d_s(ℓ) over a grid): reproduce within max_i |Δ d_s(ℓ_i)| ≤ 0.05 on the reported window.
• “Pass/Fail” decisions (step vs smooth): must match exactly under the same decision rule.

G.2 Locked parameters to reproduce the canonical instantiation (copy of the minimal set)
These are the canonical locked-for-reproducibility values referenced throughout Sections V.A–V.B.

G.2.1 Locked projection parameters (V.A.1).
• Projection kernel: Gaussian-softmax (eqV.A.1).
• Projection width: σ_Π = 0.35 (grid units) (eqV.A.2).

G.2.2 Locked kernel parameters (V.A.2).
• Kernel family: RBF on graph/orbit distance (eqV.A.4).
• Kernel selection rule: eqV.A.5.
• Toy selection parameters: G = ℤ₂, C₀ = 0.12, λ = 10^{-3} (eqV.A.6).
• Toy selected value: η* ≈ 2.606×10^{-2} (as quoted in V.A.2).

G.2.3 Locked deformation parameters (V.A.3).
• Deformation ansatz: Z_s(ρ̄)=1−f(ρ̄), Z_t(ρ̄)=1/(1−f(ρ̄)) (eqV.A.8).
• Critical density and regularization: ρ̄_crit = 3.917×10^{-2}, ε = 10^{-3} (eqV.A.12).

G.2.4 Numerical discretization defaults (toy protocol; V.B).
• N_𝒦 = 80.
• N_𝓜 = 40.
• Emergent radial grid r ∈ [1.2, 20].
• Constraint population profile parameters: u₀=40, σ_u=8, β=0.02 (eqV.B.1).

G.3 Randomness control (required for any stochastic estimator)
G.3.1 Seed policy.
• All stochastic components must use a single recorded master seed SEED_MASTER.
• Derive sub-seeds deterministically by hashing labels, e.g.:
  SEED_TRACE = hash32("trace") XOR SEED_MASTER,
  SEED_BOOT  = hash32("bootstrap") XOR SEED_MASTER,
  SEED_GW    = hash32("gw") XOR SEED_MASTER.

G.3.2 Hutchinson trace estimator reproducibility.
If Hutchinson is used, report:
• number of probe vectors n_probe,
• distribution (Rademacher ±1 recommended),
• SEED_TRACE,
• stopping rule (fixed n_probe only; do not stop adaptively unless the rule is fixed and reported).
Default: n_probe = 256, Rademacher probes.

G.4 Reproduce the spectral-dimension results (all d_s(ℓ) tables/figures)
This capsule covers all results whose primary computed object is d_s(ℓ) and any derived (ℓ*, Δd_s, κ).

G.4.1 End-to-end pipeline (graph/Laplacian → d_s(ℓ)).
Inputs:
• W (or an explicit rule to construct W),
• Laplacian convention (L or L_norm),
• ℓ-grid {ℓ_i}.
Steps:
1) Construct L.
2) Compute P(ℓ_i)=Tr(exp(−ℓ_i^2 L)).
3) Compute d_s(ℓ_i) via G.1.3.
4) Run the step-vs-smooth fit decision (IV.A.5a):
   • fit d_s^{step} and d_s^{smooth},
   • report ΔAIC := AIC_smooth − AIC_step.
5) Extract (ℓ*, Δd_s) from the fitted step model.
6) If r_H is defined in the same regime, compute κ := ℓ*/r_H.

G.4.2 Minimal pseudocode (language-agnostic).
Algorithm DS_PIPELINE(W, ell_grid, laplacian_type, w_pts, step_fit_window):
  L = build_laplacian(W, laplacian_type)
  assert is_symmetric(W)
  assert spectrum_min(L) >= -1e-12   # numerical tolerance
  for ell in ell_grid:
    P[ell] = trace(expm(-(ell*ell)*L))
  for each ell_i in ell_grid (interior):
    b = local_log_slope( x=ln(ell^2), y=ln(P), window=w_pts )
    ds[ell_i] = -2*b
  (fit_step, fit_smooth) = fit_models(ds[ell_grid], step_model, smooth_model)
  deltaAIC = AIC(fit_smooth) - AIC(fit_step)
  (ell_star, Delta_ds, w) = step_parameters(fit_step)
  return {P, ds, ell_star, Delta_ds, deltaAIC}

G.4.3 Reproducible outputs and tolerances.
Report for every d_s(ℓ) figure/table:
• the full (ℓ_i, P(ℓ_i), d_s(ℓ_i)) table (CSV-like),
• the model-comparison statistic (ΔAIC or Bayes factor),
• fitted (ℓ*, Δd_s) with uncertainty,
• the exact estimator settings (eig vs hutch; w_pts; ℓ-grid; any smoothing).

G.4.4 Mandatory null controls (to prevent estimator artifacts).
• Estimator swap: eig ↔ Hutchinson (where applicable).
• No-horizon/no-critical control run with identical estimator settings.
• One refinement (increase N or size) holding the physical scale fixed.

G.5 Per-result reproduction checklist (maps “numbers on the page” to pipelines)
This table provides a concrete checklist for reproducing each main numeric object in the paper.

Result ID (where reported) | Primary output(s) | Pipeline to run | Required config values | Numerical tolerance
---|---|---|---|---
V.B.2 (toy d_s table) | d_s(ℓ) at listed ℓ; plus g_tt, g_rr; V_Π,out(r_B); T_H proxy | DS_PIPELINE + toy horizon module | Use G.2.1–G.2.4; ℓ-grid as printed; w_pts=5 | max |Δd_s| ≤ 0.05 on the printed ℓ-grid
V.G.3 / V.G.7 | (ℓ*, Δd_s) and κ band statement | DS_PIPELINE + ℓ* extraction + κ | Use locked (σ_Π, η*) and horizon r_H definition used in the run | |Δκ| ≤ 0.02 and |ΔΔd_s| ≤ 0.1 (or within quoted uncertainties)
V.J.2 | Δd_s(N_𝒦) convergence table + extrapolation | DS_PIPELINE repeated over refinements + extrapolation fit | Use V.J.1 scaling ansatz; fixed extraction rule V.G.5 | extrapolated Δd_s(∞) within 0.05
Appendix C | GW ringdown Bayes factors and κ posteriors | GW pipeline in Appendix C | Exact provenance ledger (C.1a) + fixed preprocessing (C.1b) | κ median within 0.02 (same priors + same sampler)
V.M.4 | dn_s/d ln k posterior (when executed) | CMB inference capsule V.M.4 | Likelihood components + priors + convergence thresholds | posterior mean within 0.2σ of reproduced run

G.6 “Figure/table audit trail” reporting rule (required going forward)
For every future revision, each figure/table caption must include (at minimum):
• Capsule ID: {DS, GW, CMB}.
• Config name/version.
• RNG seed(s).
• Estimator choice and key tolerances.
• The exact source of any external data product (dataset ID).

APPENDIX H: CONSISTENCY CHECKS (DIMENSIONS, LIMITS, CLOSURE, ASSUMPTION-USE LEDGER)

Purpose. This appendix is a compact internal-consistency checklist. It is not new physics and not additional axioms. It exists so that a referee (or a future revision) can audit: (i) dimensional consistency, (ii) limiting-regime recovery, (iii) closure of the constraint/admissibility structure, and (iv) which explicit assumptions are used in each theorem/derivation.

H.0 Scope note (how to read this appendix).
• Dimensional analysis is done in two parallel conventions used in the manuscript: (i) geometric units (G=c=1) and (ii) “toy units” in discrete worked examples (dimensionless grid units). When a formula is stated in toy units, the physical-unit meaning is always via an explicit conversion map; if no conversion map is stated, the formula is treated as a dimensionless protocol statement only.
• “Limit checks” are meaning checks: they verify that the same definitions reduce to expected correspondence targets (e.g., Minkowski/weak-field) when the gates/assumptions say they should.
• “Constraint closure” means internal logical consistency under composition (e.g., admissible operations do not generate a violation of the same admissibility constraints).

H.1 Dimensional analysis checklist

H.1.1 Core dimensions used.
We treat [L] as the base dimension, with:
• [ℓ]=[r_H]=[r_+]=[M]=[t] = [L] in geometric units (G=c=1).
• [σ]=[ℓ^2]=[L^2] (diffusion time variable).
• d_s is dimensionless.
• Z_t and Z_s are dimensionless (principal-symbol deformation functions).
• f(ρ̄) is dimensionless.
• κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H is dimensionless.

H.1.2 Heat-trace / spectral-dimension sector.
Check: P(ℓ)=Tr(exp(−ℓ^2 L_ρ)) is dimensionless.
• Required: [L_ρ]=[L^{−2}] in any regime where exp(−ℓ^2 L_ρ) is interpreted as a diffusion semigroup.
• Then exp(−ℓ^2 L_ρ) is dimensionless and Tr(·) is dimensionless.
• Therefore d_s(ℓ)=−2 ∂ln P(ℓ)/∂ln(ℓ^2) is dimensionless.

H.1.3 Characteristic-speed sector.
Check: v_char/c = √(Z_s/Z_t) is dimensionless.
• Required: Z_s and Z_t are dimensionless and positive where BC2 holds.

H.1.4 Clock-rate sector.
Check: dτ/dt = 1/√(Z_t) is dimensionless.
• Required: Z_t dimensionless.

H.1.5 Horizon scale and κ.
Check: κ ≡ ℓ*/r_H is dimensionless.
• Required: ℓ* and r_H are both lengths defined in the same regime gate (so the ratio is meaningful and not mixing incompatible conventions).

H.1.6 Boundary-gradient (Hawking-scaling proxy) sector.
Check: G(x) := |∂ρ̄/∂n|/ρ̄_crit is dimensionless.
• Required: ρ̄ and ρ̄_crit have the same units (or are both dimensionless) and ∂/∂n contributes 1/[L].
• Then G has dimension 1/[L] unless an explicit length is included; therefore the manuscript’s κ_PCT definition must include exactly one factor of speed or length to set dimensions.
Consistency with the locked proxy definition:
• If κ_PCT := c·Ḡ, then in physical units κ_PCT has units of 1/[T] and acts as a surface-gravity-like frequency scale.
• If one instead uses κ_PCT := c^2·Ḡ, then κ_PCT has units of acceleration; this is acceptable but must be stated consistently.
Reporting rule for future edits: whenever κ_PCT is used, state explicitly whether κ_PCT is treated as a frequency (1/time) or an acceleration (length/time^2) quantity in the chosen unit system.

H.2 Limit checks (sanity checks against correspondence targets)

H.2.1 Flat/Minkowski correspondence limit.
Condition: ρ̄→ρ̄_0 and Z_t→1, Z_s→1 on Ω and BC1–BC2 pass.
Checks:
• v_char→c.
• dτ/dt→1.
• Cone-proxy metric g^{(L)}_{μν}→diag(−1,1,1,1).
• Any claimed “IR plateau” in d_s(ℓ) should approach the target dimension for the relevant effective model (4 in 3+1D; 1 in the explicitly stated 1D radial toy reduction).

H.2.2 Weak-field (Schwarzschild) correspondence limit.
Condition: f≪1 and the correspondence calibration f(r)=r_s/r is invoked, with BC1–BC2–BC5 passing on Ω_ext.
Checks:
• g_tt ≈ −(1−r_s/r), g_rr ≈ (1−r_s/r)^{−1} (in the adopted proxy convention).
• dτ/dt ≈ 1 − GM/(rc^2) (leading order).
• v_char/c ≈ 1 − r_s/r (in the same proxy convention).

H.2.3 Near-horizon regularized limit.
Condition: f→1−ε with ε>0 a stated regulator (and BC2 still PASS on the exterior).
Checks:
• Z_s→ε (small positive), Z_t→1/ε (large positive), so hyperbolicity is preserved in the ε-regularized scheme.
• v_char/c = √(Z_s/Z_t)→ε (strong suppression) consistent with “outward compatibility collapses.”
• Any horizon indicator defined via Θ_out and V_{Π,out} must approach the “suppressed” limit smoothly as ε→0.

H.2.4 UV/pregeometric limit (meaning check, not a GR limit).
Condition: BC1 fails (or is not reported) and/or BC2 fails.
Checks:
• Any GR/QFT-language statement is out of scope by definition.
• Only primitives (𝒦,K,ρ_𝒦,Π,ν_Θ) and θ-invariant observable definitions remain meaningful.

H.3 Constraint closure checks

H.3.1 Microclass closure under declared refinement/renormalization scheme.
Claim to check (operational): if (K,Π,ν_Θ) satisfy M1–M5 at refinement level N, then after one refinement step (N→N') under the declared scaling prescription (e.g., V.J.1), the refined objects remain in the microclass 𝒨.
Minimum closure checks to report when invoking microclass-level claims:
• PSD preservation: K remains symmetric PSD (M1) under refinement (numerically verifiable at finite N).
• Markov normalization: Π(·|u;θ) remains normalized for all (u,θ) (M2).
• Mediator normalization: ν_Θ(Θ)=1 (M3).
• Spectral-dimension stability: d_s(ℓ) admits a stable window under refinement (M5), with the exact window [ℓ_0,ℓ_1] stated.

H.3.2 No-signaling closure under composition of allowed interventions.
Operational requirement:
• If two interventions (transformations) T_A and T_B are allowed under Λ-4 / Π-factorization, then their sequential application must not generate setting-dependent marginals (parameter independence must remain true).
Practical audit hook:
• Any section that uses no-signaling as a premise should state whether the claim uses only single-shot factorization, or also requires closure under sequential composition (OP2).

H.3.3 Microcausality/hyperbolicity closure.
Operational requirement:
• If BC2 passes on Ω_ext for the operator family used, then under any admissible local perturbation within the declared variant family (e.g., small ν_Θ perturbations allowed by Λ-3, and small environment shifts used in robustness checks), BC2 should remain PASS on Ω_ext with a stated safety margin (m_t,m_s).

H.4 Assumptions-by-derivation ledger (explicit)

Purpose. Many results in the manuscript are conditional. This table records, for each frequently invoked theorem/derivation, the assumptions actually used.

Legend.
• “Math well-posedness” = measurability/normalization/integrability conditions needed to define G₂ and downstream objects.
• “Microclass” = M1–M5.
• “Gates” = BC1–BC5.
• “Locked” = choices in V.A.
• “CAL” = correspondence calibration(s), especially f(ρ̄)↔r_s/r.

| Result / derivation | What it establishes | Assumptions used (explicit) |
|---|---|---|
| Theorem 4 (continuum limit) | convergence of G₂ and L_ρ under refinement | Math well-posedness; stated convergence hypotheses; plus any scaling prescription when applied in numerics |
| Theorem 5 (metric extraction + Hawking-scaling proxy) | correlator-distance metric g^{(E)} from G₂; boundary steepness proxy κ_PCT | Math well-posedness; regularity (C^2 near diagonal); (for κ_PCT) BC2 on Ω_ext and a well-defined boundary/normal derivative estimator |
| Definition/lemma set III.F.1–III.F.8 | reconstruction map + gates + horizon/compatibility volumes | Math well-posedness; normalization of w(θ|x); BC2 required for cone proxy and horizon definitions |
| IV.A (geometry reconstruction) | d_corr, g^{(E)}_{μν}, d_s(ℓ) definitions + manifold-likeness diagnostics | Math well-posedness; regularity for metric extraction; BC1 for any “geometry/metric” interpretation; M5 for IR plateau claims |
| IV.B (microcausality) | cones, v_char, admissibility criteria | BC2 (hyperbolicity); Λ-4 / Π-factorization for no-signaling; plus any stated locality approximation for operator expansion |
| IV.D (horizons) | horizon proxy via V_{Π,out} collapse / U_out emptiness | BC2 on exterior; ε_out threshold defined; any stated regularization ε; requires a consistent outward notion |
| V.G (κ-discontinuity module) | definition and extraction of (ℓ*,Δd_s,κ) | Locked choices (V.A); estimator/protocol choices (IV.A.5a/V.G.5); refinement/robustness requirements (V.J/V.Z) |
| V.D (weak-field correspondence) | Schwarzschild-like redshift scaling | CAL mapping f(r)=r_s/r; proxy convention g_tt,g_rr; BC1–BC2–BC5 when interpreting as GR correspondence |

H.5 Per-theorem “assumptions used” list (copy-ready)

For future revisions: each theorem/proposition statement should carry an explicit “Assumptions used” list of the form:
• Domain: (Ω,[ℓ₀,ℓ₁]) specified.
• Math: measurability/integrability/normalization conditions used.
• Gates: which BC items must pass.
• Microclass: which of M1–M5 are required.
• Locked/CAL: any locked choices or calibrations invoked.
